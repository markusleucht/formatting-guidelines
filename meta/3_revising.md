# Stage 3: REVISING — Restructure and Strengthen

## Overview

Writing is an iterative process with four distinct stages:
1. **THINKING** — Clarify purpose, reader, message, and structure
2. **DRAFTING** — Get words on the page without self-censorship
3. **REVISING** (this stage) — Restructure, strengthen logic, cut ruthlessly
4. **REFINING** — Polish clarity, precision, and final details

This guide covers **Stage 3: REVISING**—transforming your rough draft into a clear, logical, powerful piece of writing.

**Core Truth:** "Second draft = First draft - 10%" (King). Revision is where you open the door and write for readers.

**When you finish this stage:** You should have a well-structured, logically sound draft with strong arguments, ready for final polishing.

## Part I: The Purpose of Revision

### What This Stage Accomplishes

Revision is where good writing is made. The draft gave you raw material; now you shape it.

**What revision does:**
- Restructures for clarity and impact
- Strengthens logic and argumentation
- Cuts unnecessary material (10% minimum)
- Improves flow and transitions
- Fixes gaps and inconsistencies
- Makes it readable for your audience

**What revision is NOT (yet):**
- Line-editing every sentence
- Perfecting word choice
- Fixing grammar and typos
- Final formatting

**Save those for Stage 4 (REFINING).** Right now, focus on big picture: structure, logic, flow.

### The Shift from Writer to Reader

**King's door metaphor:**
- **Stage 2 (Door closed):** You wrote for yourself
- **Stage 3 (Door open):** You rewrite for readers

**This requires a fundamental shift:**
- From "what do I want to say?" to "what does my reader need?"
- From generating to evaluating
- From writer's perspective to reader's perspective

**Minto's principle:** Everything must serve the reader's understanding.

---

## Part II: King's Door Open Principle

### Rewrite with the Door Open

Now you're ready to show your work—but not yet to everyone. First, revise with an imagined reader in mind.

#### The Two-Pass Approach

**Pass 1: Your Own Revision (Solo)**
- Read with fresh eyes after cooling period
- Make structural changes
- Cut ruthlessly
- Fix logic and flow
- This pass is still private

**Pass 2: Feedback and Refinement (Collaborative)**
- Share with trusted readers
- Gather specific feedback
- Identify patterns in their responses
- Revise based on insights
- Not obligated to accept every suggestion

**Today we focus on Pass 1.** Pass 2 comes after you've done your own work.

### Creating Distance

**Why cooling off matters:**
- You can't see your mistakes when emotionally attached
- Distance reveals what actually landed on the page vs. what's in your head
- Fresh eyes catch structure problems
- You can be ruthless

**King's timeline:** 6 weeks for books; 1-2 weeks for articles; at least a day for short pieces.

**Exception for deadlines:** Even a few hours helps. Walk away, come back fresh.

---

## Part III: The Read-Through

### Read Your Draft as a Reader Would

**Before making any changes, read the entire draft straight through.**

#### How to Read

**Environment:**
- Print it out if possible (seeing it in new format helps)
- Quiet space, no distractions
- Read in 1-2 sittings to maintain flow
- Have pen/highlighter ready

**Mindset:**
- Pretend you're encountering this for the first time
- What questions arise?
- Where do you get lost or confused?
- What feels redundant or boring?

**Don't fix yet—just note:**
- Mark confusing sections
- Highlight parts that drag
- Note where logic feels weak
- Circle brilliant sections (you'll want to keep these)

### Questions to Ask During Read-Through

**Structure:**
- [ ] Does the opening grab attention and set context?
- [ ] Is my main message clear early?
- [ ] Do sections flow logically from one to the next?
- [ ] Does the conclusion satisfyingly close the piece?

**Logic (Minto):**
- [ ] Is my pyramid structure clear?
- [ ] Does each section answer the question raised by the previous level?
- [ ] Are my groupings MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)?
- [ ] Do I support my claims with evidence?

**Content:**
- [ ] Have I answered my reader's question?
- [ ] Is anything missing?
- [ ] Is anything redundant?
- [ ] Where did I write around the point instead of making it?

**Flow:**
- [ ] Are transitions smooth?
- [ ] Does the pace feel right?
- [ ] Where does it bog down?
- [ ] Where does it rush?

**Write your overall observations:**
- What works well?
- What are the 3 biggest problems?
- What's the main message (can you state it in one sentence)?
- Does it match what you intended?

---

## Part IV: Structural Revision

### Fix the Big Picture First

Don't polish sentences until you've fixed structure. Polishing paragraphs you'll later delete wastes time.

#### Structural Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Weak or Missing Introduction

**Symptoms:**
- You dive into details without context
- Reader doesn't know why they should care
- The stakes aren't clear

**Minto's SCQA fix:**
1. **Situation:** Establish common ground (what's uncontroversial?)
2. **Complication:** Introduce the problem or change (what's wrong/different?)
3. **Question:** State or imply the question this raises
4. **Answer:** Your main point

**Hichert's requirement:** Message upfront. Don't bury your lead.

**Rewrite your introduction to:**
- Set clear context in 2-3 sentences
- Create tension or raise a question
- State your main point early (top of pyramid)
- Hook your reader's attention

### Problem 2: Unclear Main Message

**Symptoms:**
- You can't summarize your point in one sentence
- Your reader has to hunt for your conclusion
- Multiple competing messages

**Fix:**
- Write your message as one sentence
- Place it prominently (after SCQA intro)
- Make it a complete sentence, not a question
- Ensure everything else supports this message

**Test:** If your reader remembers only one thing, is this it?

### Problem 3: Illogical Organization

**Symptoms:**
- Ideas jump around randomly
- Related points are separated
- The order feels arbitrary

**Minto's pyramid fix:**
- Map your current structure as a pyramid
- Identify what question each section answers
- Ensure vertical logic: each level answers the question from above
- Ensure horizontal logic: groupings follow deductive, chronological, structural, or comparative order

**Restructure:**
- Group related ideas together
- Order groups logically
- Ensure each section builds on the previous
- Remove tangents that don't serve the pyramid

### Problem 4: Missing Sections

**Symptoms:**
- You jump from A to C, skipping B
- Readers will ask questions you don't answer
- Logic has gaps

**Fix:**
- What question does each section raise?
- Have you answered that question before moving on?
- Add sections that fill logical gaps
- Sometimes this means more research/thinking

**Minto's vertical logic:** Every statement raises a question. The next level must answer it.

### Problem 5: Weak Conclusion

**Symptoms:**
- You trail off or repeat yourself
- No clear next steps or implications
- The "so what?" is missing

**Fix:**
- Restate your message (differently)
- Emphasize implications or next steps
- End with impact, not summary
- Circle back to your opening (but elevated)

**Hichert's "Next Steps":** What should happen after reading this?

### Reordering Major Sections

**When to reorder:**
- Current order confuses rather than clarifies
- A later section should come earlier
- Opening section is too complex/technical
- Conclusion has your best idea (move it forward)

**How to reorder:**
- Create a new outline with better flow
- Cut-and-paste sections in new order
- Add/rewrite transitions
- Ensure logic still works

**Graham's note:** Sometimes your exploratory draft put the conclusion last. Move it to the front.

---

## Part V: Logical Revision (Minto's Principles)

### Strengthen Your Arguments

Structure is the skeleton; logic is the musculature. Now make your arguments bulletproof.

#### Test Your Pyramid

**For every section, ask:**

**1. Vertical Relationship Test:**
- What question does this section raise for the reader?
- Does the next level down answer that question?
- Is the answer complete and relevant?

**Example:**
- **Statement:** "We should expand to Asia"
- **Question it raises:** "Why?"
- **Answer (next level):** Three reasons (market size, competition gaps, our capabilities)
- **Test:** Do those three reasons actually prove we should expand? Or are they irrelevant?

**2. Horizontal Relationship Test:**
- Are ideas in each grouping the same kind of idea?
- Do they follow a logical order?
- Are they mutually exclusive (no overlap)?
- Are they collectively exhaustive (nothing important missing)?

**Example of BAD grouping:**
- Reason 1: Market is large
- Reason 2: We have the technology
- Reason 3: It's been done before
- **Problem:** These are different kinds of arguments (market, capability, precedent)—but that's okay if they're all answering "Why expand?"

**Example of overlap (NOT MECE):**
- Reason 1: Digital channels generate 70% of leads
- Reason 2: Online advertising is effective
- Reason 3: Social media drives traffic
- **Problem:** 2 and 3 overlap with 1 (they're all digital)

**3. Summary Statement Test:**
- Does your summary statement accurately capture the ideas below?
- Is it an insight, not just a label?
- Could you defend this grouping to a skeptic?

#### Strengthen Weak Logic

**Symptom: Non-sequitur**
- Your evidence doesn't actually prove your point
- **Fix:** Find evidence that directly supports your claim, or adjust your claim

**Symptom: Missing steps**
- You jump from A to C without showing B
- **Fix:** Add the intermediate logic, or make the connection explicit

**Symptom: Weak evidence**
- You assert without proving
- You use anecdotes as if they're data
- **Fix:** Add stronger evidence, or qualify your claims

**Symptom: Contradictions**
- Section 2 contradicts Section 1
- **Fix:** Resolve the contradiction or explain the nuance

#### Apply MECE Thinking

**Check every grouping:**

**Are they mutually exclusive?**
- No overlap between categories
- Each item belongs to only one group
- Clear boundaries

**Are they collectively exhaustive?**
- Everything relevant is covered
- No important gaps
- Complete picture

**Example: Analyzing revenue decline:**

**NOT MECE:**
- Customer churn
- Lost sales
- Price reductions
- **Problem:** "Lost sales" overlaps with "customer churn"

**MECE:**
- Lost customers (churn)
- Lower prices (same customers buying at lower prices)
- Lower volume per customer
- **Better:** Three distinct, non-overlapping causes that cover all possibilities

---

## Part VI: The 10% Cut

### Kill Your Darlings

**King's formula:** Second draft = First draft - 10%

**Why cut?**
- Excess words dilute impact
- Readers' time is precious
- Tighter writing is clearer writing
- Every word should earn its place

#### What to Cut

**1. Unnecessary exposition**
- Backstory your reader doesn't need
- Context that doesn't serve your message
- Historical tangents

**2. Redundancy**
- Saying the same thing twice (in different words)
- Examples that repeat each other
- Sections that overlap

**3. Weak passages**
- Sections that don't advance your argument
- Tangents that distract
- "Interesting" points that don't support your message

**4. Scaffolding (Graham)**
- "In this section I will..."
- "As I mentioned earlier..."
- "It's important to note that..."
- Just make your point

**5. Hedging and filler**
- "It seems like maybe..."
- "In my opinion..."
- "Basically..."
- "Actually..."
- Be direct

**6. Your favorite parts that don't serve the whole**
- Brilliant writing that's off-topic
- Clever tangents
- Showing off
- This is the hardest cut—and the most important

**King's wisdom:** "Kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler's heart, kill your darlings."

#### How to Cut 10%

**Method 1: Word-level cuts**
- Remove one word per sentence
- "In order to" → "To"
- "Despite the fact that" → "Although"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"

**Method 2: Sentence-level cuts**
- Remove one sentence per paragraph
- Cut the throat-clearing first sentence
- Cut the summary last sentence (if it just repeats)

**Method 3: Paragraph-level cuts**
- Remove entire paragraphs that don't pull weight
- Merge overlapping paragraphs

**Method 4: Section-level cuts**
- Remove entire sections that don't serve your message
- This hurts, but creates impact

**Track your progress:**
- First draft: 5,000 words
- After 10% cut: 4,500 words
- You'll likely find more to cut

**The Economist's standard:** Make every word count.

---

## Part VII: Improving Flow

### Transitions and Connections

Even with good structure and logic, writing can feel choppy. Flow is what makes it readable.

#### What Creates Flow

**1. Clear signposting**
- Let readers know where you're going
- "First... Second... Third..."
- "The key question is..."
- "This raises two issues..."

**2. Logical connectives**
- "Therefore..."
- "However..."
- "Because of this..."
- "In contrast..."
- Show relationships between ideas

**3. Smooth transitions between sections**
- The end of section 1 should set up section 2
- No jarring jumps
- Guide your reader's journey

**4. Paragraph-level coherence**
- One idea per paragraph
- Topic sentence signals what's coming
- Sentences connect to each other
- Last sentence bridges to next paragraph

**5. Sentence-level flow**
- Vary sentence length
- Mix simple and complex constructions
- Use rhythm and pace deliberately

#### Fixing Choppy Writing

**Symptom: Abrupt transitions**
- You jump from topic to topic
- Reader gets whiplash

**Fix:**
- Add transition sentences
- Show how ideas connect
- Use signposting

**Symptom: Too much signposting**
- "In the next section I will discuss..."
- "Having covered X, I now turn to Y..."

**Fix:**
- Cut the scaffolding (Graham)
- Just move to the next topic smoothly
- Use connective words, not meta-commentary

**Symptom: Monotonous rhythm**
- Every sentence has the same structure
- Same length
- Same pattern

**Fix:**
- Vary sentence length deliberately
- Short sentences create punch. Use them.
- Longer sentences develop complex ideas and show relationships between multiple thoughts
- Mix it up

---

## Part VIII: Content Revision

### What to Add, What to Strengthen

**After cutting, you may need to add:**

#### Missing Evidence

**Check each claim:**
- Do you assert without proving?
- Are examples sufficient?
- Is data current and relevant?

**Add:**
- Specific examples
- Data and statistics
- Expert quotes or citations
- Case studies

**Minto's standard:** Every point in your pyramid must be supported.

#### Missing Context

**Your reader needs:**
- Why this matters
- What's at stake
- What alternatives exist
- What happens if we don't act

**Add (if missing):**
- Stakes and implications
- "So what?" explanations
- Consequences and tradeoffs

#### Concrete Examples (King & Graham)

**Abstract writing is weak writing.**

**Instead of:** "Customers are dissatisfied"
**Write:** "Customer support response time increased from 2 hours to 8 hours, and complaint volume doubled"

**Instead of:** "The process is inefficient"
**Write:** "Each approval requires five signatures and takes three weeks"

**Add specific, concrete details** that make your points vivid and believable.

---

## Part IX: Getting Feedback

### Choose the Right Readers

**King's approach:** 4-8 trusted readers who represent your audience.

#### Who to Ask

**Ideal readers:**
- Understand your topic (or represent your target audience)
- Will be honest, not just nice
- Can articulate what works and what doesn't
- Respect your timeline

**Don't ask:**
- People who will just say "it's great"
- People with an axe to grind
- People who don't understand your purpose
- Too many people (creates noise)

### What to Ask For

**Be specific:**

**Don't ask:** "What do you think?"
**Ask:** "Does my main message come through clearly? Can you state it in your own words?"

**Useful questions:**
- Where did you get confused?
- Where did you lose interest?
- What question did you have that I didn't answer?
- What would you cut?
- What's my strongest point? Weakest?
- Would this convince you (if persuasive piece)?
- Did you learn what you needed (if informative piece)?

### How to Use Feedback

**Listen without defending:**
- Your job is to understand their experience
- Don't explain what you "meant"
- Don't justify your choices
- Just listen and take notes

**Look for patterns:**
- If one person says something, it might be personal preference
- If three people say the same thing, it's probably a real problem
- Focus on repeated feedback

**Distinguish between:**
- **Problems** (they identify something wrong) ← Always listen
- **Solutions** (they suggest how to fix it) ← Consider, but you decide

**You're not obligated to accept every suggestion:**
- Feedback helps you see your blind spots
- But you make the final call
- Your vision, your choices

**Minto's advice:** If multiple readers don't understand your point, the problem is your writing, not their reading.

## Part XI: Common Revision Mistakes

### 1. Polishing Too Early

**Symptom:** Perfecting sentences before fixing structure

**Consequence:** You polish paragraphs you'll later delete. Wasted effort.

**Fix:** Structure first, then logic, then polish (Stage 4).

### 2. Not Cutting Enough

**Symptom:** You cut a few words but still over target length

**Consequence:** Bloated, diluted writing. Reader's attention wanders.

**Fix:** Be ruthless. Cut 10% minimum. If it doesn't serve your message, it goes.

### 3. Ignoring Structural Problems

**Symptom:** You know the organization is weak but you line-edit instead

**Consequence:** Polished prose in the wrong order. Still confusing.

**Fix:** Fix structure first. Reorder sections. Rebuild the pyramid.

### 4. Being Too Attached

**Symptom:** You can't cut your favorite passages even though they don't fit

**Consequence:** Brilliant tangents that dilute your message.

**Fix:** Kill your darlings. Save them in a separate file if you must, but remove from this piece.

### 5. Accepting All Feedback Uncritically

**Symptom:** You change everything every reader suggests

**Consequence:** You lose your voice. The piece becomes muddled.

**Fix:** Listen to feedback, but you decide. Your vision matters.

### 6. Rejecting All Feedback Defensively

**Symptom:** You dismiss every criticism

**Consequence:** You miss your blind spots. The writing doesn't improve.

**Fix:** If multiple readers say the same thing, it's likely true. Listen.

### 7. Revising Forever

**Symptom:** You keep tweaking endlessly. Never satisfied.

**Consequence:** Nothing gets finished. Perfect is the enemy of done.

**Fix:** Set a deadline. Make your revisions. Move to Stage 4. Ship it.

## Part XII: Synthesis — Core Revision Principles

### From Stephen King
- **Door open:** Now you write for readers, not yourself
- **Cut 10%:** Second draft = First draft - 10%
- **Kill your darlings:** Remove even brilliant writing if it doesn't serve the whole
- **Cool before revising:** Distance reveals what you actually wrote vs. what you think you wrote

### From Barbara Minto
- **Test your pyramid:** Every level must answer the question from above
- **MECE groupings:** Mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive
- **Answer first:** Your main point should be clear early
- **Logic before polish:** Fix structure and arguments before word-choice

### From The Economist
- **Clarity is everything:** If it's not clear, rewrite it
- **Respect reader's time:** Every word must earn its place
- **Simple beats complex:** Choose short words, short sentences, clear structure
- **Active voice:** "We will decide" beats "A decision will be made"

### From Rolf Hichert
- **Message first:** Make sure your point is clear and prominent
- **Logical storyline:** Use pyramid structure for your arguments
- **SCQA introduction:** Situation-Complication-Question-Answer creates engagement
- **"So what?" test:** Implications and next steps must be clear

### From Paul Graham
- **Cut scaffolding:** Remove planning phrases and meta-commentary
- **Concrete over abstract:** Specific examples beat generalities
- **Conversational but tight:** Accessible language doesn't mean bloated language

### From Heinrich von Kleist
- **Articulation reveals thought:** Sometimes revision clarifies what you were trying to say
- **Let revision surprise you:** You may discover your real message while revising

---

## Conclusion: The Goal of Revision

**Your goal in Stage 3:** Transform your rough draft into a clear, logical, compelling piece of communication.

**Success looks like:**
- Solid structure (pyramid, SCQA, logical flow)
- Sound logic (no gaps, strong evidence, MECE thinking)
- Clear message (stated early, supported throughout)
- Tight writing (10% shorter, no fat)
- Reader-focused (answers their question, respects their time)

**The piece now:**
- Makes sense from beginning to end
- Builds logically
- Convinces or informs effectively
- Reads smoothly
- Is ready for final polish

**But it's not done yet.** Small rough edges remain. Sentences could be tighter. Word choice could be better. Some clarity issues persist.

That's what **Stage 4: REFINING** is for.

Now take a breath, then move to the final stage: polishing your work to excellence.
