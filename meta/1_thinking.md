# Stage 1: THINKING — Before You Write

## Overview

Writing is an iterative process with four distinct stages:
1. **THINKING** (this stage) — Clarify purpose, reader, message, and structure
2. **DRAFTING** — Get words on the page without self-censorship
3. **REVISING** — Restructure, strengthen logic, cut ruthlessly
4. **REFINING** — Polish clarity, precision, and final details

This guide covers **Stage 1: THINKING**—the preparation that determines whether your writing succeeds or fails.

**Core Truth:** Clear thinking produces clear writing. If your thinking is muddled before you start, your writing will be muddled too. Take time to clarify your thinking first.

**When you finish this stage:** You should have a clear message, know your reader, have chosen a structure, and be ready to draft.

## Part I: The Three Fundamental Questions

Before writing a single word, answer these three questions:

### 1. Why am I writing this?

**Your purpose drives everything else.**

- **To inform?** Explain something clearly without advocating
- **To persuade?** Change minds or drive action
- **To record?** Document for future reference
- **To explore?** Think through a problem by articulating it

**Warning signs you don't know your purpose:**
- You're writing because someone told you to
- You have data but no point to make
- You're writing to look busy
- You can't complete this sentence: "After reading this, my reader will..."

**King's perspective:** If you don't know what you're trying to say, don't start writing yet. First drafts are for discovery, but you need at least a situation—a starting point, a reason for being.

### 2. Who am I writing for?

**Your reader's needs determine your approach.**

- **What do they already know?** (Don't over-explain or under-explain)
- **What do they care about?** (Frame around their interests, not yours)
- **What question keeps them up at night?** (Your writing should answer it)
- **What will they do with this?** (Make a decision? Take action? Learn something?)

**The Economist's rule:** Write for an intelligent but non-specialist reader. Never assume specialized knowledge, but never talk down.

**Minto's insight:** Start with common ground (Situation) before introducing tension (Complication). Don't surprise readers with context they need to understand your point.

### 3. What is the one thing I want them to remember?

**If they forget everything else, what must they retain?**

- Can you state it in one sentence?
- Is it a message, not just a topic?
- Does it answer the question your reader actually has?

**Hichert's principle:** Reports without messages are just data dumps. Every communication needs a *Botschaft* (message)—a complete sentence that states your point.

**Bad (topic):** "Sales performance analysis"
**Good (message):** "We must shift 50% of our marketing budget to digital channels because they now generate 70% of our leads"

## Part II: Know Your Purpose

### If Your Purpose Is to Inform

**You're teaching someone something they need to know.**

**Ask before writing:**
- What's the most important thing they need to learn?
- What misconceptions do they likely have?
- What's the simplest way to explain this?
- What examples will make it concrete?

**Structure options:**
- **Problem → Solution:** Explain the challenge, then the answer
- **Question → Answer:** Pose the question, then answer it systematically
- **Simple → Complex:** Build from basic concepts to advanced

**King's advice:** Show, don't tell. Use concrete examples and specific details, not abstract explanations.

### If Your Purpose Is to Persuade

**You're trying to change minds or drive action.**

**Ask before writing:**
- What do they currently believe?
- Why would they resist my recommendation?
- What evidence will they find convincing?
- What decision or action do I want them to take?

**Minto's SCQA Framework:**
1. **Situation:** Common ground—something uncontroversial
2. **Complication:** The problem or change that creates tension
3. **Question:** The question that naturally arises
4. **Answer:** Your recommendation

**The Pyramid Principle:**
- Start with your conclusion (top of pyramid)
- Support with 3-5 key reasons (next level)
- Each reason supported by evidence (bottom level)

**Hichert's requirement:** Make your message explicit upfront. Don't make readers hunt for your point.

### If Your Purpose Is to Explore

**You're using writing to discover what you think.**

**Kleist's insight:** "L'idée vient en parlant" (The idea comes while speaking). We often discover what we think through the act of articulating it.

**This is different:**
- You don't need to know your conclusion before you start
- Writing is the thinking process, not the communication of finished thoughts
- First draft is pure discovery—door closed, no audience

**King's process:**
1. Start with a situation, not a plot
2. Let the writing reveal what you're trying to say
3. Discover your theme in the first draft
4. Shape and clarify in the second draft (door open)

**But eventually you must shift to communication mode:** Once you've discovered what you think, rewrite it for readers using the other principles here.

## Part III: Know Your Reader

### Understanding Your Audience

**Different readers need different approaches:**

#### The Busy Executive
- Wants conclusion first
- Needs clear recommendation
- Values brevity
- Judges you on clarity

**Structure:** Direct (Answer → Situation → Complication)
**Style:** The Economist's clarity and precision
**Length:** As short as possible while being complete

#### The Analytical Skeptic
- Wants to see your reasoning
- Questions assumptions
- Needs data and logic
- Will check your work

**Structure:** Standard SCQA (build the argument)
**Style:** Minto's pyramid logic with MECE completeness
**Length:** Long enough to be thorough

#### The General Reader
- Wants to understand something new
- Needs context and examples
- Appreciates clear explanation
- Values accessibility

**Structure:** Simple → Complex, with concrete examples
**Style:** Graham's conversational clarity
**Length:** As long as needed to make it clear

### The Question Test

**For every paragraph you plan to write, ask:**

1. What question does this answer for my reader?
2. Have I raised that question yet (or is it obvious)?
3. Does this actually answer the question, or am I dodging it?

**Minto's vertical logic:** Every statement raises a question. The next level down must answer that question. If you can't identify what question a section answers, cut it.

---

## Part IV: Define Your Message

### Crafting a Clear Message

**A message is not a topic. A message is a complete sentence that states your point.**

**Topic vs. Message:**
- ❌ "Marketing budget allocation" (topic)
- ✅ "We should shift 50% of marketing budget to digital channels" (message)

- ❌ "Customer retention challenges" (topic)
- ✅ "We are losing customers because response times exceed industry standards" (message)

**Test your message:**
1. Is it a complete sentence?
2. Does it answer the question your reader has?
3. Can you prove it with 3-5 key supporting points?
4. Would a reasonable person disagree (if not, it's probably not interesting)?

### The "So What?" Test

**Hichert's challenge:** After stating your message, ask "So what?"

If you can't answer with clear implications or recommendations, you don't have a message yet—you have an observation.

**Example:**
- **Statement:** "Online sales increased 30% last quarter"
- **So what?** "This means online channels now represent our primary growth opportunity and should receive increased investment"

### Messages Must Drive Somewhere

**Every message implies action or understanding:**

- **For decision-makers:** What should they decide?
- **For team members:** What should they do?
- **For learners:** What should they now understand?

**If your message doesn't enable any of these, reconsider why you're writing.**

## Part V: Choose Your Structure

### The Pyramid Principle (Minto)

**Use when:** You need to persuade with logic or present complex analysis

**Structure:**
```
Main Point (Answer)
├─ Key Reason 1
│  ├─ Supporting point A
│  ├─ Supporting point B
│  └─ Supporting point C
├─ Key Reason 2
│  └─ Supporting points...
└─ Key Reason 3
   └─ Supporting points...
```

**Rules:**
1. Ideas at any level summarize the ideas below
2. Ideas in each grouping are the same kind of idea
3. Ideas in each grouping follow logical order (deductive, chronological, structural, or comparative)

**Before writing, map your pyramid on paper:**
- What's at the top (your main point)?
- What are the 3-5 key supports?
- What evidence supports each?
- Is this MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)?

### The SCQA Framework (Minto)

**Use when:** You need to introduce your topic and build to your recommendation

**Four elements:**
1. **Situation:** Common ground your reader accepts
2. **Complication:** The problem, change, or tension
3. **Question:** What this raises for the reader (often implicit)
4. **Answer:** Your main point / top of pyramid

**Variations:**
- **Standard SCQA:** Build tension before revealing answer (recommendations)
- **Direct ASC:** Start with answer for busy executives
- **Concern CSA:** Start with problem when reader may not know it exists
- **Question QSC:** Start with question to engage curiosity

**Choose based on:**
- What does your reader already know?
- Are they expecting your recommendation?
- Do they understand why this matters?

### The Door Closed → Door Open Process (King)

**Use when:** You're writing to explore or create, then need to communicate

**Phase 1: Door Closed (Discovery)**
- Write for yourself
- Don't worry about audience
- Let the writing reveal what you're trying to say
- Push through to the end without excessive revision
- Discover your themes and message

**Phase 2: Door Open (Communication)**
- Now write for readers
- Apply structure (pyramid, SCQA, etc.)
- Cut 10% (King's formula: 2nd draft = 1st draft - 10%)
- Get feedback and revise

### The SUCCESS Framework (Hichert)

**Use when:** Creating business reports or presentations

**Structure your presentation or report:**
1. **SAY:** Clear message upfront (what you want to prove)
2. **Introduction:** Situation-Complication-Question
3. **Storyline:** Logical argument (pyramid structure)
4. **Next Steps:** What should happen after
5. **Supporting Visuals:** What words cannot easily express

**Before writing:**
- Can you state your message in one sentence?
- Can you outline your storyline logically?
- Do you know what action you want afterward?

## Part VI: Prepare Your Mind

### The Right Mindset Before You Begin

#### 1. Accept That First Drafts Are Imperfect

**King:** "First drafts are for getting it down, not getting it right."

- Give yourself permission to write badly
- Perfectionism is procrastination in disguise
- You can't edit a blank page
- The scariest moment is right before you start

#### 2. Commit to Finishing

**Decide before you start:**
- How long will this be? (rough target)
- When will I finish the first draft?
- Am I writing to discover (door closed) or communicate (structured)?

**King's rule:** Finish your first draft in a single season (3 months max). Don't let it drag endlessly.

#### 3. Clarify Your Constraints

**Ask:**
- How much time do I have?
- How long should this be?
- What format is expected?
- Who will review this?

**The Economist's discipline:** Constraints force clarity. A 500-word limit makes you identify what truly matters.

#### 4. Prepare Your Tools

**Before writing:**
- Gather your research and data
- Organize your sources
- Sketch your structure (even roughly)
- Clear your space and time

**Minto's analytical phase:** Do your thinking before you write. Work through the logic tree. Identify what you know and what you still need to learn.

### Overcoming the Blank Page

**Kleist's insight:** When stuck, articulate your confusion. Talk through it (out loud or on paper). The act of articulating generates clarity.

**Graham's approach:** Write like you talk. Start conversationally, as if explaining to a friend. You can formalize later.

**King's technique:** Start with a situation. You don't need to know where you're going—just start somewhere concrete and let the story (or argument) reveal itself.

## Part VII: The Pre-Writing Checklist

### Before You Write a Single Word

**Answer these questions. If you can't, you're not ready yet.**

#### Purpose & Message
- [ ] Why am I writing this? (inform, persuade, record, explore)
- [ ] What is my main message in one sentence?
- [ ] What question does this answer for my reader?
- [ ] After reading this, what should my reader know, believe, or do?

#### Reader & Context
- [ ] Who is my primary reader?
- [ ] What do they already know about this topic?
- [ ] What do they care about (why should they read this)?
- [ ] What will they do with this information?
- [ ] How much time do they have to read this?

#### Structure & Logic
- [ ] Have I chosen an appropriate structure? (pyramid, SCQA, narrative, etc.)
- [ ] Can I outline my key points (3-5 main supports)?
- [ ] Is my logic MECE (mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive)?
- [ ] Do I have evidence for each key point?
- [ ] What's my introduction strategy? (standard SCQA, direct answer-first, etc.)

#### Preparation
- [ ] Have I gathered all necessary research/data?
- [ ] Do I know my constraints? (length, deadline, format)
- [ ] Have I sketched a rough outline or pyramid?
- [ ] Do I know whether this is discovery writing (door closed) or communication (structured)?
- [ ] Am I mentally prepared to write imperfectly and revise later?

### The 30-Second Test

**If you can't complete these sentences, you're not ready:**

1. "This document will persuade/inform/explain _______________"
2. "My main point is _______________"
3. "My reader cares because _______________"
4. "After reading, they will _______________"

---

## Part VIII: Common Pre-Writing Mistakes

### 1. Starting Without a Message

**Symptom:** You have a topic but no point

**Fix:** Ask "So what?" until you reach something meaningful. Turn your topic into a complete sentence that states a position.

### 2. Writing for Yourself Instead of Your Reader

**Symptom:** Explaining what you found interesting rather than what your reader needs

**Fix:** Every paragraph should answer a question your reader has, not showcase what you learned.

### 3. Confusing Structure with Thinking

**Symptom:** You've decided to use "the pyramid principle" but haven't actually worked out the logic

**Fix:** Structure is a tool for organizing clear thinking, not a substitute for it. Do the thinking first.

### 4. Over-Planning Instead of Writing

**Symptom:** You've spent days on outlines and planning but haven't written anything

**Fix:** At some point you must write. If you're exploring (Kleist), start writing to discover. If you're communicating (Minto), your outline should be enough to start.

### 5. Not Knowing If You're Discovering or Communicating

**Symptom:** You try to write a structured argument but keep changing your mind about your point

**Fix:** Recognize you're in discovery mode. Write freely (door closed) to figure out what you think. *Then* shift to communication mode and structure it.

### 6. Ignoring Your Reader's Question

**Symptom:** You answer the question you wish they had, not the question they actually have

**Fix:** Listen to what they're actually asking. Sometimes the question they need answered isn't the one you want to answer—but you must answer theirs first.

### 7. Missing the "So What?"

**Symptom:** You state facts without implications

**Fix:** For every statement, ask "So what? Why does this matter? What should someone do with this information?"

---

## Part IX: Special Cases

### Writing to Discover What You Think (Kleist Mode)

**When:** You don't yet know what you think; writing is your thinking tool

**Before you start:**
- Accept that you don't have an answer yet
- Plan for two phases: discovery, then communication
- Give yourself permission to explore
- Don't invite an audience yet

**Process:**
1. Start articulating what you know and don't know
2. Write through the confusion
3. Let connections emerge
4. Keep going until something clicks
5. *Then* shift to communication mode and restructure

**Kleist's principle:** "L'idée vient en parlant"—the idea comes while speaking (or writing). Sometimes you must articulate to discover.

### Writing to Convince Skeptics (Minto Mode)

**When:** Your reader doubts your conclusion or will scrutinize your logic

**Before you start:**
- Map your complete pyramid on paper
- Ensure every level is MECE
- Test each supporting point: does it actually prove what you claim?
- Anticipate objections and address them
- Make your logic airtight

**Process:**
1. State your conclusion (top of pyramid)
2. Provide 3-5 key supporting arguments
3. For each argument, provide evidence
4. Use deductive or inductive logic consistently
5. Address counterarguments explicitly

**Minto's discipline:** Show your work. Logic must be transparent and bulletproof.

### Writing for Time-Pressed Executives (Direct Mode)

**When:** Your reader is busy and wants your conclusion immediately

**Before you start:**
- Clarify your recommendation in one sentence
- Identify the 3 reasons it makes sense
- Prepare supporting detail for questions

**Structure:**
1. **Answer first:** Your recommendation (1 sentence)
2. **Why:** 3 key reasons (3 sentences)
3. **Context:** Situation and Complication (brief)
4. **Details:** Supporting analysis (if they want it)

**The Economist's principle:** Respect your reader's time. Lead with your point.

### Writing Clear Explanations (Teaching Mode)

**When:** Your reader needs to understand something complex

**Before you start:**
- Identify what they already know
- Find the simplest starting point
- Choose concrete examples they'll relate to
- Plan your progression from simple to complex

**Process:**
1. Start where they are (common ground)
2. Build one concept at a time
3. Use specific, concrete examples
4. Check understanding before advancing
5. Show applications and implications

**King & Graham's wisdom:** Write like you talk. Use the words you'd use explaining this to a smart friend.

---

## Part X: Synthesis—The Core Pre-Writing Principles

### From Stephen King
- **First, figure out if you're discovering or communicating.** Discovery requires freedom; communication requires structure.
- **Start with a situation.** You don't need the full story, just a concrete starting point.
- **Write honestly.** If you're faking or forcing it, readers will know.
- **The scariest moment is right before you start.** Accept imperfection and begin.

### From Barbara Minto
- **Answer first, then explain why.** Don't make readers wait for your point.
- **Think in pyramids.** Every statement raises a question; the next level answers it.
- **Make it MECE.** Your logic should be complete (exhaustive) without redundancy (mutually exclusive).
- **Use SCQA to introduce.** Start with common ground (Situation), introduce tension (Complication), then answer the implied Question.

### From The Economist
- **Clarity is king.** If a sentence is unclear, it's wrong—rewrite it.
- **Simple words beat fancy ones.** "Use" beats "utilize"; "rich" beats "affluent."
- **Active voice beats passive.** "We will decide" beats "A decision will be made."
- **Respect your reader's time.** Make every word count.

### From Rolf Hichert
- **Every report needs a message.** A topic isn't enough—state your point.
- **Answer the reader's question.** If you don't know what question they have, find out.
- **Structure follows logic.** Use pyramid structure (citing Minto) for your storyline.
- **Introduction needs tension.** Situation-Complication-Question before your Answer.

### From Paul Graham
- **Write like you talk.** Conversational writing is clearer and more engaging.
- **Cut the scaffolding.** Remove the planning phrases ("In this essay I will...").
- **Use specific examples.** Concrete beats abstract every time.

### From Heinrich von Kleist
- **Speaking (writing) generates thinking.** Sometimes you must articulate to discover what you know.
- **Confusion is part of the process.** Writing through uncertainty can produce clarity.
- **The interlocutor matters.** Even an imagined reader helps sharpen your thinking.

## Conclusion: The Essential Pre-Writing Question

**Before you write anything, ask yourself:**

> "If my reader could remember only one thing from this, what would I want it to be?"

If you can answer that in one clear sentence, you're ready to write.

If you can't, you're not ready yet. Keep thinking.

---

**Final reminder:** Writing is thinking made visible. If your thinking is clear before you start, your writing will be clear. If your thinking is muddled, no amount of good writing technique will save you.

Take time before writing to clarify your thinking. The minutes you spend now will save hours later.
