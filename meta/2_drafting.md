# Stage 2: DRAFTING — Getting Words on the Page

## Overview

Writing is an iterative process with four distinct stages:
1. **THINKING** — Clarify purpose, reader, message, and structure
2. **DRAFTING** (this stage) — Get words on the page without self-censorship
3. **REVISING** — Restructure, strengthen logic, cut ruthlessly
4. **REFINING** — Polish clarity, precision, and final details

This guide covers **Stage 2: DRAFTING**—transforming your thinking into a complete first draft.

**Core Truth:** First drafts are for getting it down, not getting it right. Give yourself permission to write imperfectly.

**When you finish this stage:** You should have a complete rough draft from beginning to end, ready for revision.

## Part I: The Purpose of Drafting

### What This Stage Accomplishes

Drafting is where thinking becomes tangible. This stage has one primary goal: **get a complete first draft, beginning to end.**

**What drafting is:**
- Getting your ideas out of your head and onto the page
- Following your structure (or discovering it as you go)
- Building momentum and completing the journey
- Creating raw material to shape later

**What drafting is NOT:**
- Perfecting every sentence
- Stopping to edit and polish
- Worrying about what readers will think
- Getting every word exactly right

### The Two Drafting Modes

**Discovery Mode (Kleist):**
You're still figuring out what you think. Writing IS your thinking process.
- No clear conclusion yet
- Structure may emerge as you write
- Exploring and connecting ideas
- Finding your message through articulation

**Structured Mode (Minto/Hichert):**
You know your message and structure. Now you're filling it in.
- Clear pyramid or outline to follow
- You're expressing known ideas
- Following your SCQA or SUCCESS framework
- Executing your plan from Stage 1

**Most writing combines both:** You may have a clear structure but discover new insights while drafting. That's normal.

---

## Part II: King's Door Closed Principle

### Write with the Door Closed

**Stephen King's central metaphor:** The first draft is written with the door closed—just you and the story. No audience, no critics, no market concerns.

#### Why Close the Door?

**Freedom to explore:**
- You can try things that might not work
- No pressure to be brilliant
- Permission to write badly
- Space to discover what you're really trying to say

**Protection from premature judgment:**
- Critics (internal or external) kill momentum
- Perfectionism is procrastination in disguise
- The first draft doesn't need to impress anyone
- You'll fix it in revision

**Focus on completion:**
- The goal is to finish, not to shine
- Keep moving forward
- Push through the difficult middle
- Resist the urge to show anyone

#### How to Close the Door

**Practically:**
- Write in a private space
- Turn off notifications
- Don't share as you go
- Don't read it back obsessively

**Mentally:**
- Remember: this is for you
- "I'll fix it in revision" becomes your mantra
- Accept imperfection
- Trust the process

### The First Draft Belongs to You

**King's wisdom:** "Write with the door closed, rewrite with the door open."

First draft = private discovery
Second draft = communication to readers

Don't confuse the two stages. Right now, in drafting, you're writing for yourself.

---

## Part III: Maintaining Momentum

### The Cardinal Rule: Keep Writing

**The biggest drafting mistake:** Stopping to perfect what you've written before you finish.

**Why momentum matters:**
- Writing builds on writing
- Stopping kills energy
- You lose the thread
- Perfectionism prevents completion

### King's Daily Practice

**2,000 words per day, minimum:**
- Write every day (including weekends)
- Same time, same place
- Don't stop until you hit your target
- Finish first drafts in a single season (3 months maximum)

**Why a word count goal:**
- Makes the task concrete
- Forces you to keep going
- Builds discipline
- Ensures completion

**Adjust to your situation:**
- If you're new: start with 500-1,000 words/day
- For long projects: 1,500-2,000 words/day
- For short pieces: finish in one sitting if possible
- For business writing: complete sections daily

### Handling the Urge to Edit

**When you want to go back and fix:**

**DON'T:**
- Stop drafting to perfect earlier sections
- Re-read obsessively
- Polish sentences endlessly
- Delete large chunks in panic

**DO:**
- Leave a note: "[FIX: clarify this later]"
- Keep moving forward
- Trust you'll improve it in revision
- Remember: you can't edit a blank page

**Graham's advice:** Cut the scaffolding later. Right now, build the structure.

### Techniques to Maintain Flow

**1. Write in Chunks:**
- Set timer for 25-50 minutes
- Write without stopping
- Short break
- Repeat

**2. Skip Ahead When Stuck:**
- Can't write the introduction? Start with the middle
- Stuck on section 2? Jump to section 3
- Fill gaps later
- Keep momentum

**3. Use Placeholders:**
- "[INSERT EXAMPLE HERE]"
- "[FIND DATA]"
- "[EXPLAIN MORE]"
- Come back in revision

**4. Lower Your Standards Temporarily:**
- "This is terrible but I'll fix it later"
- Good enough beats perfect and stuck
- Movement beats stagnation
- Done beats ideal

## Part IV: Kleist's Discovery Mode

### Writing as Thinking

**Heinrich von Kleist's insight:** "L'idée vient en parlant"—the idea comes while speaking (or writing).

Sometimes you don't know what you think until you try to articulate it. Writing becomes the thinking process itself.

#### When to Use Discovery Mode

**You're in discovery mode when:**
- You don't yet have a clear conclusion
- You're exploring a complex problem
- You know the topic but not your position
- Writing is helping you understand

**This is normal and valuable.** Don't fight it—embrace it.

#### How to Draft in Discovery Mode

**1. Start Articulating What You Know:**
- Write out what you currently think
- Include uncertainties and questions
- Don't worry about structure yet
- Let connections emerge

**2. Follow Threads:**
- When something interesting appears, pursue it
- Let one idea lead to another
- Don't prematurely judge relevance
- Trust the process of exploration

**3. Write Through Confusion:**
- "I'm not sure, but maybe..."
- "One possibility is... another is..."
- "This doesn't quite make sense yet because..."
- Articulating confusion often produces clarity

**4. Watch for the Moment of Clarity:**
- Suddenly you see what you're trying to say
- Connections click into place
- Your message becomes clear
- Mark this moment!

**5. Once You Find Your Message:**
- Note it clearly
- Finish your exploratory draft
- Then prepare to restructure in revision
- Discovery mode → Structured communication

### The Role of the Interlocutor

**Kleist's observation:** Having an imagined listener (even silent) sharpens your thinking.

**Try:**
- Imagine explaining to a specific person
- "Dear [colleague/friend], here's what I'm thinking..."
- The imagined audience forces coherence
- You discover what you think by explaining

### When Discovery Drafting Takes Longer

**This is exploration, not final writing:**
- You may write more than you'll ultimately use
- That's fine—you're thinking through writing
- The insights you discover are the real product
- You'll restructure in revision

**Graham's note:** Much of this exploratory writing gets cut. It's scaffolding—necessary for construction, removed before you show anyone.

---

## Part V: Structured Drafting Mode

### When You Know Your Message

If you completed Stage 1 (THINKING) thoroughly, you know:
- Your message
- Your reader
- Your structure (pyramid, SCQA, etc.)
- Your key supporting points

Now you're filling in the framework.

#### Following Your Structure

**Minto's Pyramid:**
If you mapped your pyramid in Stage 1, draft in this order:

**Option 1: Top-Down (Recommended)**
1. Write your main point (top of pyramid)
2. Write your 3-5 key supporting points (second level)
3. Fill in evidence for each point (third level)
4. Write your introduction (SCQA)

**Option 2: Bottom-Up (When Evidence Drives)**
1. Write out your evidence and analysis
2. Synthesize into key supporting points
3. Crystallize your main message
4. Write introduction

**Most effective:** Combine both—sketch top-down, fill in bottom-up, refine top-down.

#### Using SCQA to Structure Your Introduction

**Draft your introduction last or first—both work:**

**Draft it first if:**
- It helps you warm up
- You need to set context for yourself
- It frames your thinking

**Draft it last if:**
- You're still discovering nuances
- Your message might evolve while drafting
- You want to see what you actually wrote first

**The four elements:**
1. **Situation:** Common ground (2-3 sentences)
2. **Complication:** The problem or change (2-3 sentences)
3. **Question:** Often implicit, but clear
4. **Answer:** Your main point (1-2 sentences)

Then launch into your supporting arguments.

#### Hichert's SUCCESS Storyline

**For business presentations/reports:**

1. **Message first:** State your conclusion clearly
2. **Introduction (SCQA):** Build context
3. **Storyline:** Logical argument (pyramid)
   - Deductive: Major premise → Minor premise → Conclusion
   - Inductive: Three examples → Generalization
4. **Next steps:** What should happen after
5. **Supporting visuals:** Note where they'll go

**In drafting, focus on the logic:** Get the words right first. Visuals come in Stage 4 (REFINING).

## Part VI: Overcoming Resistance

### Writer's Block and How to Push Through

**King's insight:** Writer's block is fear masquerading as inability.

#### Types of Resistance

**1. "I don't know what to say"**
- **Diagnosis:** You skipped Stage 1 (THINKING)
- **Solution:** Go back. Clarify your message first.

**2. "It's not good enough"**
- **Diagnosis:** Premature perfectionism
- **Solution:** Lower your standards. Write badly. Fix in revision.

**3. "I'm stuck on this section"**
- **Diagnosis:** Over-thinking one part
- **Solution:** Skip ahead. Come back later.

**4. "I don't feel inspired"**
- **Diagnosis:** Waiting for muse
- **Solution:** Inspiration is for amateurs. Professionals show up and write.

**5. "This isn't what I planned"**
- **Diagnosis:** Discovery mode interfering with structure
- **Solution:** Let it happen. Note the changes. Keep writing.

### The Antidote to Resistance

**Just write the next sentence.**

- Don't think about the whole project
- Write one sentence
- Then another
- Build word by word

**King:** "The scariest moment is always just before you start." After that, it gets easier.

### Tools for Breaking Through

**1. Free Writing:**
- Set timer for 10 minutes
- Write without stopping about your topic
- Don't judge, don't edit
- Often breaks the logjam

**2. Talk It Out:**
- Explain your point out loud (Kleist)
- Record yourself
- Transcribe
- You'll discover clarity by speaking

**3. Change Your Medium:**
- Stuck on computer? Try pen and paper
- Stuck at desk? Write while walking (phone notes)
- Stuck in formal mode? Write an email to a friend explaining your point

**4. Write a Bad Version:**
- Give yourself permission to write the worst version
- Make it deliberately awful
- Gets past perfectionism
- Usually it's not as bad as you think

**5. Remember Your Why:**
- Who needs this information?
- What question are you answering?
- Why does this matter?
- Reconnect to purpose

---

## Part VII: Special Considerations

### When Your Draft Deviates from Your Plan

**This is normal.** Writing reveals what thinking alone cannot.

**What to do:**
- Note the changes but keep writing
- Don't go back to re-plan (yet)
- Finish the draft with your new direction
- Assess in Stage 3 (REVISING) whether the changes work

**The draft often improves on the plan.** Trust the process.

### Handling New Ideas Mid-Draft

**Keep writing, but note the idea:**
- "[NOTE: This suggests I should also cover X]"
- "[TODO: Might need to reorder sections]"
- "[QUESTION: Does this change my message?]"

**Don't stop to restructure now.** Finish the draft, then reassess.

### When You Discover Your Message While Drafting

**Excellent! This is Kleist's principle in action.**

**What to do:**
1. Mark the moment clearly
2. Note your new message
3. Finish the draft with this new clarity
4. In Stage 3 (REVISING), restructure to reflect your discovered message

**This happens often:** You think you know what you're saying, then writing reveals a deeper or different point.

### The Middle Crisis

**Common phenomenon:** The beginning flows, the middle bogs down, you can see the end but can't reach it.

**Graham's insight:** The middle is where you're actually figuring things out. It's supposed to be hard.

**Solutions:**
- Lower your standards for the middle
- Bullet-point what needs to be covered
- Write rough versions, fill in details in revision
- Skip sections, come back
- Remember: every writer experiences this

### Writing vs. Editing Energy

**Recognize they're different:**

**Writing energy (now):**
- Generative
- Forward momentum
- Tolerates messiness
- "Yes, and..."

**Editing energy (later):**
- Evaluative
- Refinement
- Demands precision
- "Is this right?"

**Don't let editing energy invade drafting stage.** Protect your generative mode.

## Part VIII: The Drafting Checklist

### How to Know You're Done with Stage 2

**You've completed a successful draft when:**

- [ ] You have a complete draft from beginning to end
- [ ] Every major section in your outline (or discovered structure) has been written
- [ ] Your main message is stated somewhere (even if it needs refinement)
- [ ] Your key supporting points are present (even if rough)
- [ ] You've written to the end without stopping to perfect
- [ ] You resisted the urge to share it prematurely
- [ ] The draft is imperfect but complete

**It's time to move to Stage 3 (REVISING) when:**
- [ ] You've reached your planned length (roughly)
- [ ] You have no more major ideas to add
- [ ] You've maintained "door closed" mode throughout
- [ ] You're ready to step back and see it with fresh eyes

### The Cooling Off Period

**King's crucial advice:** Let your draft sit before revising.

**Minimum:** 6 weeks for books; 1-2 weeks for articles; 1-2 days for short pieces

**Why this matters:**
- You need distance to see clearly
- Emotional attachment fades
- Mistakes become visible
- You can be ruthless

**During the cooling off period:**
- Work on something else
- Don't peek at the draft
- Don't tinker
- Trust the waiting time

**Exception:** Tight deadlines may require faster turnaround. Even a few hours of distance helps.

## Part IX: Common Drafting Mistakes

### 1. Editing While Drafting

**Symptom:** You keep stopping to perfect sentences, deleting paragraphs, restructuring before you finish

**Consequence:** You never finish. Momentum dies. The draft stays incomplete.

**Fix:** Separate the modes. Draft now, edit in Stage 3.

### 2. Sharing Too Soon

**Symptom:** You show your draft before you're done, or immediately after finishing

**Consequence:** Premature feedback disrupts your vision. You lose confidence. Others' opinions interfere with your discovery.

**Fix:** Finish the draft. Let it cool. *Then* share for feedback in Stage 3.

### 3. Re-Reading Obsessively

**Symptom:** You keep scrolling back to read what you've written

**Consequence:** You lose forward momentum. You get stuck editing earlier sections. You never advance.

**Fix:** Resist the urge. Keep moving forward. Read it in Stage 3.

### 4. Quitting in the Middle

**Symptom:** The draft is 70% done but you've lost steam. You start a new project or claim you'll "come back to it."

**Consequence:** Unfinished drafts accumulate. You never complete anything.

**Fix:** Push through. Lower standards if needed. Finish badly rather than not at all.

### 5. Waiting for Inspiration

**Symptom:** You only write when you "feel like it" or "are in the mood"

**Consequence:** Inconsistent progress. Projects drag on forever. Writing becomes harder, not easier.

**Fix:** Show up daily. Write even when you don't feel inspired. Discipline beats motivation.

### 6. Letting Discovery Mode Paralyze You

**Symptom:** "I can't write until I figure out exactly what I'm saying"

**Consequence:** You never start. Analysis paralysis.

**Fix:** Write to discover. Let articulation generate clarity (Kleist).

### 7. Ignoring Your Outline

**Symptom:** You had a plan but abandoned it completely without reflection

**Consequence:** You end up somewhere random and have to extensively restructure.

**Fix:** If you deviate, note why. Intentional changes are fine; aimless wandering wastes time.

## Part X: Synthesis — Core Drafting Principles

### From Stephen King
- **Door closed:** Write the first draft for yourself, not for readers
- **Daily discipline:** Show up every day. Write your word count. Don't wait for inspiration.
- **Finish completely:** Push through to the end before you revise anything
- **The scariest moment is just before you start:** After that, it gets easier

### From Barbara Minto
- **Structure before writing (usually):** If you know your pyramid, follow it top-down
- **Discovery is okay:** Sometimes structure emerges while drafting
- **Answer first:** State your conclusion, then support it (top of pyramid first)

### From Rolf Hichert
- **Message clarity:** Even in a rough draft, your message should be present
- **SCQA for introduction:** Situation-Complication-Question-Answer frames your draft

### From Paul Graham
- **Conversational tone:** Write like you talk—you'll clarify in revision
- **Cut scaffolding later:** Planning phrases and hedges can stay for now; remove in editing
- **Concrete over abstract:** Use specific examples even in rough draft

### From Heinrich von Kleist
- **Writing IS thinking:** Sometimes you discover what you think by writing it
- **Articulation generates clarity:** The act of forming sentences reveals connections
- **Embrace discovery:** Don't resist the insights that emerge while drafting

### From The Economist
- **Simplicity (even in draft):** Choose simple words over fancy ones, even now
- **Active voice:** Prefer active constructions as you draft
- **One idea per sentence:** Keep it simple as you go

---

## Conclusion: The Goal of Drafting

**Your goal in Stage 2:** Create a complete, imperfect first draft.

**Success looks like:**
- Beginning → middle → end (complete)
- Main message stated (even if roughly)
- Key points present (even if underdeveloped)
- Written with momentum (even if uneven)
- Door closed (no one has seen it yet)

**Failure looks like:**
- Endless perfecting of the first three paragraphs
- Abandoning halfway through
- Sharing prematurely and losing confidence
- Never actually writing, just planning
- Waiting for inspiration

**Remember:** You can't edit a blank page. The draft, however imperfect, is progress. Get it done.

Now let it cool, then move to **Stage 3: REVISING**.
