# Write Like You Talk

## Main Idea

The core advice is straightforward: adopt conversational language in your writing to reach more readers effectively.

## The Problem with Formal Writing

Most people shift into an unnatural register when writing. As the author notes, "No one uses 'pen' as a verb in spoken English. You'd feel like an idiot using 'pen' instead of 'write' in a conversation."

The example of calling Picasso "the mercurial Spaniard" illustrates how awkward formal constructions become when imagined in actual speech. Such elaborate phrasing creates distance between writer and reader.

## Why Conversational Language Works Better

Complex written language demands more effort from readers and grants attention permission to wander. Paradoxically, fancy vocabulary can deceive writers into believing they're conveying more depth than they actually are.

Interestingly, subject matter experts discussing specialized topics "don't use sentences any more complex than they do when talking about what to have for lunch." The author observes that difficult concepts actually benefit from informal expression—language shouldn't obstruct understanding.

## The Practical Solution

The author recommends reading drafts aloud, asking whether each sentence sounds natural in conversation. When something feels stilted, revise it to match spoken speech patterns.

For severely formal writing, a more radical approach works: explain your draft to a friend verbally, then use that explanation as your rewrite.

## The Payoff

Writing conversationally positions you ahead of most writers automatically. The technique requires minimal effort yet yields substantial improvements in accessibility and engagement.
