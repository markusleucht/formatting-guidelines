# Rolf Hichert's SUCCESS Rules: A Comprehensive Reference Guide

## Overview

Rolf Hichert's "SUCCESS" methodology represents a systematic approach to management information design and business communication. Developed from over two decades of consulting experience and formalized in the International Business Communication Standards (IBCS), the SUCCESS rules provide a comprehensive framework for creating clear, effective management reports and presentations. The title of Hichert's keynote—"Damit Berichte etwas berichten" (So that reports actually report something)—captures the core problem: many business reports fail to communicate effectively because they lack clear messages, consistent notation, and appropriate information density.

## Part I: The Problem - Why Managers Don't Understand Their Reports

### The Communication Crisis

Hichert identifies a fundamental disconnect in business communication:

**The Complaint from Report Writers:**
- "Our reports don't get the attention they deserve"
- "Management doesn't read what we prepare"
- "We spend hours on reports that go unread"

**The Complaint from Report Readers:**
- "I don't have time to read all these reports"
- "Reports are too long and unclear"
- "I can't find the key information I need"

This mutual dissatisfaction signals a systemic problem in how business information is communicated.

### The PowerPoint Culture Problem

Hichert criticizes what he calls the "PowerPoint Culture":

**Characteristics:**
- Presentations have become synonymous with "showing PowerPoint slides"
- A film-like sequence runs behind the presenter
- Slides contain bullet points, text, and non-speaking visuals
- The presenter explains the slides rather than the slides supporting the presenter

**The Result:**
- Audiences are relieved when the presentation ends
- No applause, no encores
- Instead of the audience thanking the presenter for insights, the presenter thanks the audience for their attention
- The medium has replaced the message

**What's Wrong:**
- "A picture is worth a thousand words" becomes inverted
- It takes thousands of words to explain the pictures
- Slides should help understand the presenter, not vice versa

### The Root Causes

Hichert identifies three fundamental problems:

#### 1. Unknown Questions

**The Issue:**
"If management would say what interests them, we would answer it"

**The Reality:**
- Report creators don't know what questions readers actually have
- Reports and presentations should be answers to specific questions
- Without knowing the questions, reports become data dumps rather than insights

**The Solution:**
- Report creators must actively learn what questions their audience wants answered
- Communication should be demand-driven, not supply-driven
- Every report should explicitly answer a reader's burning question

#### 2. Missing Messages

**The Issue:**
Reports present data without interpretation or recommendations

**The Reality:**
- Many reports are simply statistics or data compilations
- No explanation of what the data means
- No recommendations for action
- Just numbers without narrative

**The Solution:**
- Reports must have a clear message (Botschaft)
- The message should be a complete sentence
- Messages should be statements, explanations, warnings, or recommendations
- If there's nothing to report, call it what it is: a statistical overview

#### 3. Lack of Rules

**The Issue:**
Inconsistent notation and poor design make reports hard to understand

**The Reality:**
- Different colors, shapes, and structures used arbitrarily
- No consistent visual language across reports
- Low information density wastes time
- Decoration drowns out information

**The Solution:**
- Apply consistent notation rules (like maps, musical scores, or technical drawings)
- Use high information density
- Eliminate decorative elements
- Follow the SUCCESS principles

## Part II: Forms of Business Communication

### Management Reports (Schriftliche Kommunikation)

**Definition:**
Written documents in a prescribed, repeatable structure containing primarily quantitative data.

**Characteristics:**
- Formal structure that repeats
- 5-50 pages typical (sometimes 100+ pages)
- Both informational and documentary purpose
- Should contain complete sentences, not just bullets
- Text interrupted by tables, diagrams, and graphics

**Types:**
- Annual reports, quarterly reports
- Monthly reports, departmental reports
- Project reports, status reports
- Decision papers, meeting documents
- Intranet/portal reports

**Key Components:**
- Clear structure and table of contents
- Defined page types (title page, content, summary)
- Report objects: text, diagrams, tables, graphics
- Numbered objects referenced in text
- Management summary at the beginning

**The Problem with PowerPoint Reports:**
Many organizations now print PowerPoint slides and staple them together as "reports":
- Very low information density
- Incomplete sentences
- Bullets instead of arguments
- Visual noise from misunderstood corporate design
- Poor results

**What Reports Should Be:**
- Primarily text with supporting visuals
- Complete sentences and logical argumentation
- Clear messages at the start
- Like a professional book, not a slide deck

### Business Presentations (Mündliche Kommunikation)

**Definition:**
Formal oral communication where presenters deliver a prepared message to an audience, interrupted only by questions.

**Purpose:**
- Convey a specific message
- Achieve desired action after the presentation
- Leverage presenter's credibility and expertise
- Cannot be replaced by simply showing slides

**Typical Scenarios:**
- Project status and planning
- Financial results presentation
- Management business updates
- Investment decision preparation
- Monthly controller summaries
- Training sessions

**Key Elements:**

**1. Introduction (Einleitung):**
- Situation: Current state, uncontroversial context
- Complication: Problem, change, or challenge
- Question: What needs to be answered

**2. Message (Botschaft):**
- The central point of the presentation
- What you want to prove or make credible
- Why the presentation is being given
- Must be explicit and clear

**3. Storyline:**
- Logical argumentation using pyramid principle (Barbara Minto)
- Deductive or inductive reasoning
- Well-structured proof of the message
- Clear logical connections

**4. Next Steps:**
- What should happen after the presentation
- Desired decisions or actions
- Clear outcomes expected

**5. Supporting Visuals:**
- Show what words cannot easily express
- Complex information that benefits from visualization
- Not text slides or bullet points
- Visual support, not crutches

**Common Problems:**
- Lack of clear message
- Missing tension arc in introduction
- No recognizable storyline
- Too much text on slides
- Reading slides to audience
- Slides used as public speaker notes

**The Difference from "PowerPoint Culture":**
A good presentation:
- Has a clear story to tell
- Uses the presenter's expertise and credibility
- Shows visuals that enhance understanding
- Could be summarized in one sentence
- Leads to action after the presentation

A PowerPoint Culture presentation:
- Amounts to "let me show you my slides"
- Presenters explain their visuals
- No clear narrative thread
- Audience follows along passively
- Nothing happens afterward

## Part III: The SUCCESS Framework

### Overview of the Seven Rules

SUCCESS is an acronym representing seven fundamental principles for effective business communication:

**S - SAY** (Botschaft verfassen)
Deliver clear messages

**U - UNIFY** (Inhalt vereinheitlichen)
Standardize content through consistent notation

**C - CONDENSE** (Information verdichten)
Concentrate information for better understanding

**C - CHECK** (Richtigkeit verlangen)
Ensure quality and accuracy

**E - ENABLE** (Konzept umsetzen)
Implement the concept organizationally

**S - SIMPLIFY** (Darstellung vereinfachen)
Simplify representation by avoiding noise and redundancy

**S - STRUCTURE** (Strukturen verdeutlichen)
Clarify structures using MECE principles

### Why Rules Matter

**The Principle:**
Successful business communication requires binding rules, not creativity.

**What's Needed:**
- Consistent standardization
- Reduction to essentials
- Neither verbal creativity nor visual creativity
- Disciplined application of standards

**The Analogy:**
Just as maps, musical scores, technical drawings, and circuit diagrams use standardized notation that everyone can understand, business reports need the same level of standardization.

**Without Rules:**
- Every report looks different
- Readers must relearn the visual language each time
- Colors mean different things in different charts
- Structures vary arbitrarily
- Understanding requires unnecessary effort

**With Rules:**
- Consistent visual language across all reports
- Faster comprehension
- Ability to compare across time and units
- Professional appearance
- Reduced cognitive load

---

## Part IV: SAY - Crafting Messages

### The Fundamental Principle

**Core Rule:**
If you don't say what you have to say, you won't be understood.

**The Problem:**
This seemingly obvious rule is frequently violated in business communication.

### What is a Message?

**Definition:**
A message (Botschaft) is a complete sentence that conveys:
- A statement (Feststellung)
- An explanation (Erklärung)
- A warning (Warnung)
- A recommendation (Empfehlung)

**Not a Message:**
- "Export share is 35%" (banal statement)
- "Sales Development" (just a topic)
- "Quarter 3 Results" (just a label)
- "Personnel Costs" (just a category)

**Good Messages:**
- "Sales declined 19% due to three competitive factors" (explanation)
- "We should stop Project B because the market is too small" (recommendation)
- "Phase 3 was completed four days late because cold January weather hampered concrete work" (explanation)

### The Hierarchy of Message Quality

Hichert provides a detailed hierarchy of message types, from worst to best:

**A. Title Only (Worst):**
- "Personnel Costs"
- "Project Phases"
- "System Modules"
- Just names a topic

**B. Improved Title:**
- "Higher Personnel Costs"
- "Phase 3 Delayed"
- "Missing Integration"
- At least indicates direction

**C. Banal Statement:**
- "Personnel costs have various cost types"
- "The project is divided into phases"
- "Some system modules are not integrated"
- States the obvious

**D. More Precise Banal Statement:**
- "We distinguish personnel costs into three cost types"
- "The project is divided into four phases"
- "System modules A and C are not integrated"
- More specific but still not insightful

**E. Factual Statement:**
- "Personnel costs exceed budget by 3%"
- "Phase 3 was completed four days late"
- "Missing integration causes additional costs of 2.3 million EUR"
- Provides concrete information

**F. Explanation (Better):**
- "Actual personnel costs are 3% higher than budgeted because CO-1 planned a lower wage increase"
- "Phase 3 was completed four days late because cold January weather hampered concrete work"
- "Missing integration of modules A and C causes additional costs of 13 EUR per unit due to redundancy"
- Explains why something happened

**G. Recommendation (Best):**
- "With the plan change from March 22, we can maintain the personnel cost budget despite wage increases"
- "The planned capacity expansion in Phase 3 will enable us to begin Phase 4 on schedule"
- "With additional development effort of about 200 hours, we could avoid additional costs of 13 EUR per unit"
- Proposes action based on the situation

**Key Insight:**
Most PowerPoint presentations contain messages at levels A through E. What audiences most value are explanations (F) and recommendations (G).

### Messages in Different Contexts

#### Chart Messages

**Requirements:**
- Every chart should have a clear message as a complete sentence
- The message should be the answer to the question the reader has
- Not just a title, but an assertion

**Message Placement:**
- Typically above or below the chart
- Clearly separated from the title
- Often highlighted or in a different format

**Visual Support:**
- Messages should be supported by visual highlighting
- Circles, arrows, or underlining to draw attention
- Trend indicators showing direction
- Comparisons made visually obvious

**Example:**
- Title: "Alpha Corporation, Sales in EUR, Jan-Jul 2010"
- Message: "Stuttgart achieved best profit growth vs. 2006 (+8.2 kEUR) and was 19 kEUR above budget"
- Visual: Stuttgart location highlighted with circle and arrow

#### Table Messages

**Similar Principles:**
- Complete sentence summarizing the key insight
- What should the reader take away?
- Not just repeating what's in the table

#### Text Messages

**Paragraph Structure:**
- Start with the conclusion or key point
- Then provide supporting details
- "Bottom line up front" principle
- Lucy's letter example: "I hate you. Here are my three reasons." vs. long buildup

#### Report Messages

**Executive Summary:**
- Should contain the main recommendations or findings
- Complete sentences, not bullets
- Key insights up front
- Detailed support follows

**Presentation Messages:**
- Entire presentation should be summarizable in one sentence
- This becomes the core message
- Everything else supports this central point

### The "So What?" Test

**The Question:**
For every piece of information, ask "So what?"

**The Test:**
- If you can't answer "so what?" there's no message
- The answer to "so what?" is your message
- If the answer is "nothing special," don't include it

### Messages Between Slides

**In Presentations:**
The key messages are what you say between slides, not what's on the slides.

**Technique:**
- Slide 1 appears
- You explain its significance (the message)
- Transition to why this matters
- Slide 2 appears to support the next point
- You continue the narrative

**Avoid:**
- Reading what's on the slide
- Explaining the slide itself
- Using slides as your speaking notes
- Making the slides the focus

### Highlighting Messages

**Visual Techniques for Emphasis:**

**1. Warnings (Warnungen):**
- Red triangles or warning symbols
- Highlight negative deviations
- Draw attention to problems

**2. Trends (Trends):**
- Arrows showing direction
- Up/down indicators
- Growth or decline markers

**3. Differences (Differenzen):**
- Bars showing comparisons
- Delta symbols (Δ)
- Plus/minus indicators

**4. Reference Lines (100% Linie):**
- Baseline for comparison
- Budget lines
- Target lines

**Principle:**
Systematize how you use visual elements. Each type of highlighting should have a consistent meaning throughout all your reports.

---

## Part V: UNIFY - Standardizing Content

### The Core Principle

**The Rule:**
What looks the same should mean the same thing, and vice versa.

**The Goal:**
Create a consistent visual notation system like:
- Maps (consistent symbols, colors, scales)
- Musical scores (standardized notation everyone can read)
- Technical drawings (universal symbols and conventions)
- Circuit diagrams (consistent electrical symbols)

**Why It Matters:**
- Dramatically speeds up information comprehension
- Reduces cognitive load
- Enables comparison across reports
- Creates professional consistency
- Eliminates confusion

### The Four Levels of Unification

#### Level 2.1: Unify Applications and Objects

**Consistency Across:**
- Reports and presentations
- Charts, tables, and text
- Different report types
- Various organizational units

**What to Unify:**
- Similar use of chart types
- Table formats and structures
- Text layouts and styles
- Graphics conventions

**Example:**
If a rounded border means "actual values" in charts, it should mean the same in tables and text boxes.

#### Level 2.2: Unify Components

**Dimensions to Standardize:**

**1. Measures:**
Distinguish clearly between:
- **Value Measures** (monetary): Flow (Sales, Cash Flow, Costs) vs. Stock (Equity, Receivables, Inventory)
- **Volume Measures** (quantities): Flow (Shipments, New Products) vs. Stock (Employees, Sales Area)
- **Ratios**: Value/Value (Profit/Sales), Volume/Volume (Staff/Shipments), Value/Volume (Sales/Staff), Volume/Value (Area/Sales)

**2. Time Periods:**
Standardize representation of:
- Years (2010, '10, 10)
- Quarters (Q1, 2010-Q1, I/2010)
- Months (Jan, January, 2010-01, 01/2010)
- Weeks (W17, 2010-W17, CW17)
- Days (specific formats)

**Notation Recommendations:**
- Years: Four digits (2010) or abbreviated with apostrophe ('10)
- Quarters: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
- Months: Three-letter abbreviations (Jan, Feb, Mar) or 2010-01 format
- Axes should use consistent grid patterns

**3. Data Categories:**
Distinguish between:
- **Previous Year (PY):** Gray, no border
- **Actual (ACT):** Dark (black/dark gray), solid border
- **Budget (BUD):** Light gray, dashed border
- **Forecast (FC):** Patterned, dotted border

**Colors and Forms:**
- ACT: Solid dark bars/lines
- BUD: Outline or light fill
- FC: Hatched or patterned
- PY: Solid gray

**4. Organizational Dimensions:**
- Products, Companies, Countries, Customers
- Projects, Divisions, Districts, Suppliers
- Processes, Accounts, Locations, Partners

**5. Analyses:**
Standardize symbols for:
- **Differences:** x-y (ACT'10 - ACT'09 = ΔPY)
- **Time Spans:** a..b (Feb..Jun'10)
- **Year to Date:** _x (_Jun'10)
- **Rolling:** ~x (~Jun'10)
- **Average:** Ø (Ø'10)
- **First/Last Day:** .x or x. (.Aug'10 or Aug.10)
- **Sorting:** ▼▲ (▼Sales)

**6. Comparisons and Deviations:**
- **Absolute Deviations:** ΔPY, ΔBUD, ΔFC
- **Percentage Deviations:** ΔPY%, ΔBUD%, ΔFC%
- Visual representation with bars or markers

#### Level 2.3: Unify Elements

**Chart Elements:**
- **Data Series:** Consistent colors, patterns, widths
- **Axes:** Standard grids, no y-axis values when possible
- **Labels:** Direct labeling preferred over legends
- **Titles:** Consistent structure across all charts

**Table Elements:**
- **Headers:** Consistent fonts, sizes, alignment
- **Columns:** Standard widths and formats
- **Rows:** Consistent spacing and highlighting
- **Sum Rows:** Always below, consistently formatted

**Page Layout:**
- **Grids:** Consistent raster systems
- **Frames:** Standard borders and spacing
- **White Space:** Systematic use of margins

**Colors, Lines, and Fonts:**
- Limited color palette (typically 2-3 functional colors)
- Standard line weights
- Maximum 2-3 font sizes
- One font family throughout

#### Level 2.4: Unify Language

**Sentence Structure:**
- Start with conclusions, not buildup
- Consistent paragraph structures
- Standard section openings

**Glossary:**
Essential for consistency:
- **Long Form:** "Return on Investment" (for row labels)
- **Short Form:** "Ret. on inv." (for column headers)
- **Abbreviation:** "ROI" (for space-constrained areas)
- **Definition:** Precise specification of calculation method
- **Translation:** If multilingual reports

**Numbers and Units:**
- **Standard:** 3 456 (space as thousands separator)
- **Not:** 3.456 or 3,456 (ambiguous internationally)
- **Decimal:** 1.234 5 (period for decimal, space for grouping)
- **Units:** TEUR, mill. EUR, kg, m² (consistent abbreviations)
- **Dates:** 2010-05-01 (ISO format, unambiguous)
- **Periods:** 2010-Q2, 2010-W17, 2010-02 (standardized)

**Symbols:**
- EUR, USD, GBP (not €, $, £ in international contexts)
- 23 m not 23 m. (space between number and unit, no period)
- 20 s not 20 sec. (standard SI abbreviations)

### The IBCS Standards

Hichert's work evolved into the International Business Communication Standards (IBCS), which provide comprehensive rules for:
- Semantic notation (meaning of visual elements)
- Perceptual notation (how elements are perceived)
- Pragmatic notation (practical application rules)

**Key IBCS Concepts:**
- **Semantic Rules:** What colors, patterns, and positions mean
- **Perceptual Rules:** How to ensure visibility and clarity
- **Pragmatic Rules:** When to apply which visualization

## Part VI: CONDENSE - Concentrating Information

### The Counterintuitive Principle

**The Rule:**
Higher information density leads to better understanding, not worse.

**The Paradox:**
- Most people assume: Simpler = Easier to Understand
- Reality: Concentrated information enables pattern recognition and comparison
- Caveat: Must still be legible and clear

### Why High Density Works

**Cognitive Benefits:**
- Enables comparison across multiple dimensions
- Reveals patterns and relationships
- Reduces need to remember across pages
- Allows the eye to find connections
- Facilitates "at-a-glance" understanding

**Practical Benefits:**
- Fewer pages to navigate
- Less printing and distribution
- Faster review time
- More respect for reader's time

**Example:**
Four charts on one page are easier to understand than the same four charts on four separate pages, because you can compare them simultaneously.

### The Information Density Crisis

**PowerPoint Problem:**
Typical PowerPoint presentations have extremely low information density:
- Large logos and headers waste space
- One simple chart per slide
- Lots of white space (not functional)
- Text bullets instead of arguments
- 10+ PowerPoint slides can be summarized in one A4 page of flowing text

**Business Chart Problem:**
Many business charts are used merely to decorate banal insights:
- Pie chart showing "export share is x%"
- Bar chart for simple two-number comparison
- Excessive decoration drowns out information

### Four Principles for Higher Density

#### 1. Show Everything (Nichts Weglassen)

**The Rule:**
Show all data, including extremes and outliers.

**Benefits:**
- Details increase credibility
- Outliers often contain the most important information
- Complete picture prevents manipulation
- Patterns emerge from complete data

**Avoid:**
- Arbitrarily cutting off ranges
- Hiding unfavorable data
- Simplifying to the point of meaninglessness

#### 2. Show Comparisons (Vergleiche Zeigen)

**The Rule:**
The main purpose of charts is to show comparisons, ideally in 2+ dimensions.

**Techniques:**
- Multiple data series in one chart
- Time on one axis, categories on the other
- Small multiples for complex comparisons
- Overlay charts for direct comparison

**Single-Dimension Charts (Often Inadequate):**
- Pie charts (only show proportions, no time dimension, no comparisons)
- Single bar charts (what's the comparison?)
- Isolated numbers (compared to what?)

**Multi-Dimension Charts (Better):**
- Time series with multiple categories
- Geographic comparisons over time
- Actual vs. Budget vs. Previous Year
- Multiple product lines with regional breakdowns

#### 3. Show Causes (Ursachen Zeigen)

**The Rule:**
When possible, charts should demonstrate causality or explanation.

**Techniques:**
- Waterfall charts showing how components build to a total
- Connected charts showing cause and effect
- Tree diagrams showing hierarchical relationships
- Correlation charts showing relationships

**Example:**
Instead of just showing profit declined, show:
- Sales decreased by X
- Plus: costs increased by Y
- Minus: one-time gain of Z
- Equals: profit change

#### 4. Integrate Text and Labels (Texte und Beschriftungen Integrieren)

**The Rule:**
Descriptions and annotations should be integrated directly into charts, not relegated to legends or footnotes.

**Direct Labeling:**
- Label data series directly on the chart
- Place values at the end of bars/lines
- Integrate explanatory text into the visualization
- Minimize need for legends

**Eliminate:**
- Color-coded legends requiring back-and-forth eye movement
- Footnotes that break the flow
- External references to understand the chart

### Examples of High Density

**Small Multiples:**
- 12-16 mini-charts showing same metric across different dimensions
- Each chart is small but part of a comprehensive view
- Enables instant pattern recognition
- Shows much more than 12-16 separate pages would

**Integrated Tables and Charts:**
- Sparklines integrated into table cells
- Small bar charts in table columns
- Bullets and arrows for deviations
- Single-page comprehensive view

**Dashboards:**
Multiple related metrics on one page:
- Key figures with trend indicators
- Multiple time periods visible
- Comparisons across categories
- Visual warnings and highlights

### What High Density Is NOT

**Not:**
- Cramming illegible text
- Making fonts too small to read
- Cluttering with decoration
- Overwhelming without structure
- Confusing complexity

**Is:**
- Maximum meaningful information per page
- Still clearly legible
- Well-organized and structured
- Functional use of space
- Comparison-enabling density

### Negative Example: Low Density

**Bad PowerPoint Slide Example:**
- Huge logo taking 20% of space
- Title taking 10% of space
- One simple pie chart
- Large legend
- Minimal actual information
- Could be stated in one sentence

**Better Alternative:**
Put the same information in a single sentence in flowing text, or combine with 9 other related insights on one page with much higher information value.

## Part VII: CHECK - Ensuring Quality

### The Quality Dimensions

Quality in business communication means the information is:

**1. Correct (Richtig):**
- Data collected, calculated, and condensed without errors
- Definitions used consistently
- Sources verified and traceable

**2. Complete (Vollständig):**
- Exhaustive in relation to the message
- All relevant information included
- No important gaps

**3. Current (Aktuell):**
- As up-to-date as possible
- Appropriate for the decision timing
- Reflects latest available information

**4. Relevant (Relevant):**
- Supports the specific message
- Appropriate for the audience
- Addresses the question being asked

### Data Quality

**For Quantitative Data:**

**Measures (Messgrößen):**
- Clearly defined (what exactly is "sales"?)
- Consistently calculated across reports
- Appropriate units specified
- Documented in glossary

**Units (Einheiten):**
- Clearly stated (EUR, USD, TEUR, mill. EUR)
- Consistent within a report
- Appropriate precision (don't use 47.3% if 47% suffices)

**Dimensions:**
- Products, countries, organizational units, time periods
- Clearly identified and consistently labeled
- MECE (see STRUCTURE section)

**Data Types:**
- Actual, Budget, Forecast, Previous Year
- Clearly distinguished
- Consistently notated

### Content Quality

**For Text and Messages:**

**Precision (Präzision):**
- Specific rather than vague
- "3.5 million EUR cost reduction" not "relevant cost cut"
- "Between 98 and 102 units" not "around 100 units"
- "Deviation of +9%" not "significant deviation"
- "6 or 7 tons" not "more than 5 tons"
- "3% above plan" not "much better than plan"

**Accuracy (Genauigkeit):**
- Statements that can be verified
- Sources cited when appropriate
- Facts distinguished from opinions
- Correct causality (caused vs. correlated)

**Honesty (Ehrlichkeit):**
- Unfavorable information included
- Limitations acknowledged
- Uncertainties disclosed
- No manipulation through selective presentation

### Visualization Quality

**Appropriate Chart Types:**
- Time data shown with time-series charts (line, column)
- Structure data shown with structure charts (bar, stacked)
- Not using pie charts for time data
- Not cutting axes inappropriately
- Not distorting scales or areas

**Correct Scaling:**
- Axes start at zero for bar charts (unless showing deviation)
- Consistent scales when comparing similar metrics
- Appropriate range for the data
- No logarithmic scales unless truly needed

**Proper Labeling:**
- All axes labeled with units
- Data series identified clearly
- Sufficient precision in numbers
- Not over-labeling with redundant information

### Combining Tables and Charts

**When to Use Both:**
- Chart shows the pattern
- Table provides the precise numbers
- Together they give complete picture

**Integration:**
- Small chart embedded in table
- Or table and chart side by side
- Not redundant, but complementary

---

## Part VIII: ENABLE - Implementing the Concept

### The Challenge

**Reality:**
SUCCESS is more than just improving chart appearance. It requires changing the culture of business communication.

**Requirements:**
- Problem awareness among stakeholders
- Understanding of SUCCESS benefits
- Available tools and templates
- Established governance
- Support from senior management

**Without These:**
No sustainable change is possible.

### The Four Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Build Awareness (Problembewusstsein Schaffen)

**Goal:**
Recognize the need for change.

**Activities:**
- Show examples of current problems
- Demonstrate cost of poor communication
- Calculate time wasted
- Present SUCCESS benefits
- Get stakeholder agreement on the problem

**Key Questions:**
- Do people realize reports aren't being read?
- Do they understand why?
- Do they see the cost of the status quo?

**Messages to Convey:**

**For Reports:**
Every report should have a one-page message summarizing major findings or suggestions.

**For Presentations:**
Every presentation should start with a clear message answering the audience's questions.

**For Charts:**
Every chart should contain a message; the visualization should explain or prove this message.

**The Realization:**
Many people think their communication is fine. Awareness of the problem is the first step.

#### Step 2: Plan Introduction (Einführung Planen)

**Evolution vs. Revolution:**

**Evolution (Recommended):**
- Gradual rollout by business unit or report type
- Pilot projects to demonstrate value
- Learning from early implementations
- Building momentum through success stories

**Revolution (Risky):**
- All reports changed simultaneously
- "Big bang" approach
- Higher risk of resistance
- Harder to correct course

**Rollout Phases:**
A. Develop notation and layout standards
B. Select software and tools
C. Develop templates
D. Test with pilot reports and presentations
E. Roll out concept and tools across organization

**Prototyping:**
- Start with prototype versions
- Test with real users
- Refine based on feedback
- Scale up to full application

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Phased approach
- Clear milestones
- Measurable success criteria
- Flexibility to adjust based on learning

#### Step 3: Realize the System (System Realisieren)

**People:**

**Training Required:**
- **Content:** Understanding data quality and relevance
- **Message:** Transforming data into insights
- **Notation:** Applying uniform methods and layout
- **Software:** Learning to use the tools effectively
- **Process:** Understanding how SUCCESS fits into workflows

**Roles:**
- Report creators
- Report reviewers
- Report consumers
- Tool administrators
- Governance board

**Software:**

**Functions Needed:**

**Data Collection:**
Facilitate correct data acquisition:
- Interfaces to source systems
- Data validation rules
- Automated consistency checks
- User-friendly input masks

**Data Presentation:**
Support clear messages:
- Template libraries

## Part IX: SIMPLIFY - Simplifying Representation

### The Core Principle

**The Goal:**
Eliminate unnecessary elements while preserving all necessary information.

**The Challenge:**
Information lies between noise (unnecessary) and redundancy (duplicated).

**Two Strategies:**
1. Avoid noise (Rauschen vermeiden)
2. Minimize redundancy (Redundanz minimieren)

### Avoiding Noise

**Definition of Noise:**
Misunderstood "design" that doesn't contribute to understanding.

**Common Sources:**

#### 1. 3D Visualization Without Meaning

**The Problem:**
- 3D effects in bar charts, pie charts
- Perspective distorts perception
- No additional information conveyed
- Actually hinders accurate comparison

**Example:**
3D pie chart makes it impossible to accurately judge slice sizes.

**The Solution:**
Use 2D visualization unless 3D genuinely represents a third data dimension.

#### 2. Lines, Marks, and Axes Without Meaning

**The Problem:**
- Gridlines that don't help reading values
- Y-axis scales that are redundant with data labels
- Tick marks on every data point
- Border boxes that serve no purpose

**The Solution:**
- Minimize or eliminate vertical gridlines
- Remove y-axis scale if values are labeled
- Use only functional gridlines
- No borders unless they convey meaning

#### 3. Colors Without Meaning

**The Problem:**
- Different colors for each bar in a simple chart
- Decorative color choices
- Inconsistent color use across charts
- "Rainbow effect" in tables

**The Solution:**
- Use color only to convey meaning
- Gray for non-highlighted items
- Color (typically one accent color) for emphasis
- Consistent color meaning across all reports

#### 4. Frames and Shadows Without Meaning

**The Problem:**
- Drop shadows on every element
- Decorative borders
- Background patterns
- Chart area fill colors

**The Solution:**
- White/light gray backgrounds only
- No shadows unless functionally necessary
- Borders only to separate distinct sections
- Simplicity and clarity over decoration

#### 5. Special Fonts Without Meaning

**The Problem:**
- Multiple font families
- Excessive use of bold and italic
- Unnecessary font size variations
- Decorative script fonts

**The Solution:**
- One font family (typically sans-serif)
- 2-3 font sizes maximum
- Bold only for emphasis, not by default
- Regular weight for body text

#### 6. Elaborate Visuals

**The Problem:**
- Complicated gauge charts
- 3D figures and icons
- Photorealistic illustrations
- Fancy arrows and connectors

**The Solution:**
Simple, clean 2D shapes:
- Basic bars, lines, areas
- Simple arrows for trends
- Functional icons only
- Clarity over artistic impression

#### 7. Special Effects in Presentations

**The Problem:**
- Animated transitions between slides
- Flying bullets
- Dissolves and fades
- Sound effects
- Rotation and zoom

**The Solution:**
- No transitions (or at most simple fade)
- Content appears all at once, not animated
- Focus on substance, not spectacle
- Presenter provides the "special effects" through explanation

#### 8. Crude Lines and Forms

**The Problem:**
- Heavy line weights
- Thick borders
- Bold gridlines
- Oversized symbols

**The Solution:**
- Thin lines (0.5-1 pt)
- Delicate but visible
- Proportional to data markers
- Subtle rather than dominating

### Minimizing Redundancy

**Definition:**
Redundancy is the repetition of information that's already clear from context.

**Necessary vs. Unnecessary Redundancy:**
Some redundancy aids understanding (repeating year on axis labels for clarity). But most redundancy just wastes space and attention.

#### 1. Redundant Terms

**The Problem:**
- "Total" when it's already clear it's a total
- "Sum" when shown as the bottom row
- "Overall" when only one entity is shown
- "Grand Total Alpha Corporation Sales sum in EUR"

**The Solution:**
- "Alpha Corporation, Sales in EUR" (sufficient)
- "Europe" not "Europe Grand Total"
- Totals go in a consistently formatted row without extra labeling

#### 2. Redundant Text

**The Problem:**
- "Account Table CO" "Account CO4712" "Account CO4733"...
- Repeating the same prefix or suffix in every row
- Unnecessary articles and prepositions

**The Solution:**
- "Accounts CO4" as header, then "712", "733", "845"...
- Concise labels
- Remove repeated words

#### 3. Redundant Axis Labels

**The Problem:**
- "2010" repeated for Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
- "Region East" "Region West" "Sales by region"
- Every month labeled with the year

**The Solution:**
- Year at start and end of axis only
- "East" "West" as direct labels
- "Sales by region 2010" as title

**Example:**
Instead of:
"Q1 2010" "Q2 2010" "Q3 2010" "Q4 2010"

Use:
"2010 → Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4"

#### 4. Redundant Title Elements

**The Problem:**
- "Sales sum Germany total"
- "Development of stock" (Development implied by time axis)
- "Headcount statistic" (Structure implied by visual)
- "Key performance diagram" (Obvious it's a diagram)

**The Solution:**
- "Sales Germany"
- "Stock"
- "Headcount"
- Focus on content, not format descriptions

### Omitting Distracting Details

**The Principle:**
Concentration on essentials means omitting:

#### 1. Labels for Small Values

**When to Omit:**
- Values below a certain threshold (e.g., <5% of maximum)
- Would clutter the visualization
- Adds no meaningful information

**Solution:**
- Label only significant values
- Small values shown by bar/line size only
- Detailed values available in accompanying table if needed

#### 2. Long Numbers

**The Problem:**
- "366,123,456 USD"
- "52.231"
- "39.459"

**The Solution:**
Use 3-digit display:
- "366 mill. USD" or "366.1 mill. USD"
- "52.2"
- "39.5"

**Rationale:**
- Easier to read and compare
- Precision beyond 3 digits rarely meaningful
- Use detailed numbers in tables when needed

#### 3. Unnecessary Labels

**The Problem:**
Over-labeling every data point on time-series charts creates:
- Visual clutter
- Difficulty seeing the pattern
- Redundant information (shape of line conveys the values)

**The Solution:**
- Label only peaks, valleys, start, end
- Let the line/bar itself convey intermediate values
- Use detailed table alongside if exact values needed

### The Balance

**Key Principle:**
Simplification is not about removing information, but about removing non-information (noise and redundancy) so the actual information stands out clearly.

**Test Questions:**
- Does this element convey information?
- If I remove it, is anything lost?
- Is this information stated elsewhere?
- Does the decoration add or distract?

## Part X: STRUCTURE - Clarifying Structures

### The Core Principle

**The Rule:**
Reports and presentations are easier to understand when all groupings and listings follow these structural rules:

1. **Homogeneous (Gleichartig):** List similar elements together
2. **Mutually Exclusive (Überschneidungsfrei):** No overlaps in categories
3. **Collectively Exhaustive (Erschöpfend):** Cover all relevant aspects

**Recognition:**
These are the MECE principles (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) from Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle, which Hichert integrates into the SUCCESS framework.

### Homogeneous Structures (Gleichartig)

**The Rule:**
At each level of any hierarchy or list, all elements should be of the same kind.

#### In Arguments

**Bad Example:**
"Objectives:
- Improve quality
- Reduce costs
- Many delays (not an objective)
- Reduce price"

**Good Example:**
"Objectives:
- Improve quality
- Reduce costs
- Avoid delays
- Reduce price"

**The Fix:**
"Many delays" is an observation, not an objective. Changed to "Avoid delays" to match the pattern of objectives.

#### In Report Sections

**Bad Example:**
"Report:
- Balance sheet
- Payables (part of balance sheet)
- Receivables (part of balance sheet)
- Costs
- Staff
- Sales"

**Good Example:**
"Report:
- Balance sheet
- Profit & Loss statement
- Cash flow
- Staff metrics
- Sales analysis"

**The Fix:**
Don't mix summary categories with detailed subcategories. Keep hierarchical levels consistent.

#### In Wording

**Bad Example:**
"Report:
- Balance sheet figures
- List of payables
- Receivables list
- Costs
- Staffing ratios
- Sales report"

**Good Example:**
"Report:
- Balance sheet
- Payables
- Receivables
- Costs
- Staff
- Sales"

**The Fix:**
Consistent level of detail and consistent grammatical form. Either all are "X report" or all are just "X."

#### In Forms

**Bad Example:**
"Weather: Sunny ☀, Rainy ☂, Windy 🌬, Snow ❄, Storm ⛈, Clouds ☁"

**Good Example:**
"Weather: Sun ☀, Rain ☂, Wind 🌬, Snow ❄, Storm ⛈, Clouds ☁"

**The Fix:**
All nouns, not mixing nouns and adjectives. Parallel grammatical structure.

#### In Chart Elements

**Bad Example:**
A chart showing "Sales, Costs, Vertrieb (another word for Sales), Ergebnis (Result)"

**Good Example:**
"Sales, Costs, Marketing, Result"

**The Fix:**
No duplicate concepts. All at same level of the income statement.

### Mutually Exclusive Structures (Überschneidungsfrei)

**The Rule:**
Categories should not overlap. Each item should fit into exactly one category.

#### In Dimensions

**Bad Example:**
"Countries:
- Austria
- Germany
- Switzerland
- Norway
- Sweden
- Scandinavia (overlaps with Norway and Sweden)
- Denmark
- Finland"

**Good Example:**
"Countries:
- Austria
- Germany
- Switzerland
- Norway
- Sweden
- Denmark
- Finland"

**Alternative Grouping:**
"Regions:
- DACH (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
- Scandinavia (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland)"

**The Fix:**
Either list countries individually, or group them into regions, but don't mix levels.

#### In Measures

**Bad Example:**
"Calculation:
- Sales
- Costs of goods sold
- Discounts (part of net sales)
- Contribution
- Fixed costs
- Depreciation and interest (both are fixed costs)
- Profit
- Earnings before Tax (overlaps with Profit)"

**Good Example:**
"Calculation:
- Sales
- Costs of goods sold
- Contribution
- Fixed costs
- Profit"

**The Fix:**
Remove subcategories and overlapping terms. Clean hierarchy.

#### In Project Structure

**Bad Example:**
"Project:
- Objectives (future-looking)
- Requirements (future-looking, overlaps with objectives)
- Results (past-looking)"

**Good Example:**
"Project:
- Objectives
- Requirements
- Results"

Or better yet:

"Project:
- Planning
- Execution
- Outcomes"

**The Fix:**
Separate phases rather than overlapping categories.

#### In Tables and Charts

**Bad Example:**
Europe structure:
- Germany
- UK
- Austria
- France
- Switzerland
- Rest of Europe
- Europe (this is the total, overlaps with all above)

**Good Example:**
Structure with total separate:
- Germany
- UK
- Austria
- France
- Switzerland
- Rest of Europe
- **Total: Europe**

**The Fix:**
Total is shown separately, clearly as the sum, not as another category.

### Collectively Exhaustive Structures (Erschöpfend)

**The Rule:**
Categories should cover all relevant items with no gaps.

#### In Arguments

**Bad Example:**
"We think of all options:
- New products, old location
- Old products, old location
- New products, new location"

**What's Missing:**
"Old products, new location"

**Good Example:**
"We think of all options:
- New products, old location
- Old products, old location
- New products, new location
- Old products, new location"

**The Fix:**
Complete the 2x2 matrix. All four combinations covered.

#### In Geographic Coverage

**Bad Example:**
"Europe:
- Germany
- UK
- Austria
- France
- Switzerland"

**What's Missing:**
Many European countries (Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, etc.)

**Good Example:**
"Europe:
- Germany
- UK
- Austria
- France
- Switzerland
- Rest of Europe"

**The Fix:**
Add "Rest of Europe" to make it exhaustive.

#### In Charts

Visual example showing incomplete vs. complete coverage:
- Incomplete: Showing only selected countries
- Complete: Showing all countries or adding "Rest of Europe" category

#### In Tables

Similar principle applies:
- Show all relevant categories
- If some are grouped as "Other," make that explicit
- Totals should genuinely include everything

### Application in Report Structure

#### Page Types

**Good Structure:**
1. Title page
2. Table of contents
3. Management summary
4. Content pages (standard types)
5. Appendix

**Each section has:**
- Clear purpose
- No overlap with other sections
- Together they're complete

#### Content Flow

**Hierarchical Principle:**
```
Report
├─ Section 1
│  ├─ Subsection 1.1
│  ├─ Subsection 1.2
│  └─ Subsection 1.3
├─ Section 2
│  ├─ Subsection 2.1
│  └─ Subsection 2.2
└─ Section 3
```

**MECE at Each Level:**
- Sections 1, 2, 3 are MECE
- Within Section 1, subsections 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 are MECE
- And so on

### Common MECE Frameworks for Business

**Time:**
- Past, Present, Future
- Years: 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023
- Quarters: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4

**Geography:**
- By continent: Europe, Americas, Asia-Pacific, etc.
- By country: Germany, France, UK, etc.
- By region within country

**Organization:**
- By division
- By function (Sales, Marketing, Operations, Finance, HR)
- By product line

**Process:**
- Sequential steps (Step 1, Step 2, Step 3)
- Funnel stages (Leads → Qualified → Proposals → Wins)

**Financials:**
- Income Statement: Revenue - Costs = Profit
- Balance Sheet: Assets = Liabilities + Equity
- Cash Flow: Operating + Investing + Financing

**Business Model:**
- Customer Segments
- Value Propositions
- Channels
- (etc., from Business Model Canvas)

## Part XI: Report Objects - Charts (Diagramme)

### The Purpose of Charts

**Definition:**
Charts are visual representations of numerical arrangements.

**Purpose:**
- For seeing, not reading (in contrast to tables)
- Show patterns, trends, relationships
- Demonstrate causes and effects
- Not to decorate banal insights

**Key Principle:**
"Charts should say something. They should convey a message."

### Chart Types and Their Uses

Hichert presents a systematic overview of 36+ chart types, organized by purpose:

#### Time-Series Charts (Zeitreihendiagramme)

**Purpose:** Show development over time

**Type 1: Column Charts**
- Vertical bars
- For discrete time periods
- Compare values across time
- Good for showing monthly, quarterly, or yearly data

**Variations:**
- 1a: Simple columns
- 1b: Stacked columns (show components)
- 1c: Columns with scenario highlighting (AC, BUD, FC)

**Type 2: Pin Charts (Stab/Pin)**
- Vertical lines with markers
- Less visual weight than columns
- Good for frequent data points
- Shows precise values with dots

**Variations:**
- 2a: Simple pins
- 2b: Pins with range indicators (showing min/max or confidence intervals)

**Type 3: Waterfall Charts**
- Show how components add to a total
- Start value + increases - decreases = end value
- Excellent for variance explanation

**Type 4: Horizontal Waterfall/Tornado**
- Same as waterfall but horizontal orientation
- Good for emphasizing positive/negative

**Type 5: Line Charts**
- Connected data points
- Best for continuous data
- Shows trends clearly
- Can overlay multiple series

**Variations:**
- 5a: Simple line
- 5b: Multiple lines
- 5c: Line with area fill
- 5d: Area chart (stacked lines)

**Type 6: Variance Charts**
- Show changes from baseline
- +/- around a zero line
- Excellent for deviation analysis
- Show up/down fluctuations clearly

#### Structure Charts (Strukturdiagramme)

**Purpose:** Show parts of a whole or compare categories

**Type 7: Simple Bars**
- Horizontal bars for categories
- Easy to read labels
- Natural for many categories

**Type 8: Pins (Horizontal)**
- Alternative to bars
- Less visual weight
- Good for showing ranges

**Type 9: Multiple Bar Sets**
- Compare across categories and scenarios
- Grouped or clustered bars

**Type 10: Waterfall Horizontal**
- Like Type 3 but horizontal
- Good for variance analysis by category

**Type 11-12: Vertical Structures**
- Bars or areas
- Alternative orientations

**Type 15: Stacked Bars**
- Show component parts
- Useful for composition analysis

**Type 21-22: Diverging Bars**
- Show positive/negative splits
- Start from center line
- Good for survey data or variance

#### Specialized Charts

**Type 17: Scatter Plots**
- Show relationships between two variables
- Identify correlation
- Spot outliers
- Bubble charts (add third dimension via size)

**Type 18: 3D Columns (Acceptable Use)**
- Only when third dimension adds information
- Geographic or categorical third axis
- Not for decoration

**Type 23-24: Matrices and Portfolios**
- 2x2 or larger matrices
- Strategic positioning
- Bubble sizes for third variable
- BCG matrix, etc.

**Type 29: Combination Charts**
- Multiple elements (pie segments, bars, etc.)
- Show complex relationships
- Use sparingly

**Type 30: Network Diagrams**
- Show connections and relationships
- Organizational charts
- Process flows

**Type 35-36: Area Charts**
- Stacked areas over time
- Show changing composition
- Risky: Can be hard to read

### Chart Elements and Notation

#### Essential Chart Components

**1. Title:**
Complete identification including:
- Organization unit: "Alpha Corporation"
- Measure: "Sales"
- Unit: "in mill. EUR"
- Time period: "Jan-Dec 2010"
- Data type: "ACT, BUD"

**Format:** "Alpha Corporation, Sales in mill. EUR, Jan-Dec 2010 ACT vs BUD"

**2. Message:**
Complete sentence stating the insight:
- "Sales increased 15% exceeding budget by 2 mill. EUR"
- "Stuttgart achieved best profit growth (+8.2 kEUR)"

**3. Data Series:**
- Clearly differentiated (color, pattern, form)
- Directly labeled (no legends)
- Consistent notation across all charts

**4. Axes:**
- Horizontal (category/time axis): Always present
- Vertical (value axis): Often omitted if values are labeled
- Grid lines: Minimal, only if helpful

**5. Labels:**
- Direct labeling preferred
- Values at end of bars/lines or integrated
- Category labels horizontal (readable)

**6. Highlighting:**
- Circles, arrows, or markers for message support
- Trend indicators
- Difference markers
- Consistent visual language

#### Elements to Avoid

**1. Y-Axis Values (Often Unnecessary):**
- If bars are labeled with values, y-axis is redundant
- Creates clutter
- Doubles the number of numbers shown

**2. Vertical Gridlines:**
- Rarely helpful
- Create visual noise
- Horizontal gridlines occasionally useful

**3. Legends:**
- Require eye movement back and forth
- Break the flow
- Direct labeling is superior

**4. 3D Effects:**
- Distort perception
- No additional information
- Harder to read accurately

**5. Background Fills:**
- Distracting
- Reduce contrast
- No functional purpose

**6. Border Boxes:**
- Unnecessary framing
- Visual weight without information
- White space is sufficient separation

### Specific Chart Recommendations

#### Bar vs. Column

**Use Columns When:**
- Time series (time naturally flows left to right)
- Few categories (< 8)
- Emphasizing change over time

**Use Bars When:**
- Many categories (8+)
- Long category labels (easier to read horizontal text)
- Emphasizing ranking or comparison

#### Lines vs. Bars

**Use Lines When:**
- Continuous data (temperatures, stock prices)
- Many data points
- Emphasizing trends and patterns
- Multiple series to compare

**Use Bars When:**
- Discrete periods (months, years)
- Emphasizing individual values
- Fewer data points
- Component breakdown (stacked)

#### Pie Charts - Generally Avoid

**Problems:**
- Hard to compare slice sizes accurately
- Only shows one dimension (proportions)
- Takes up lot of space
- Labels are awkward
- Can't show time dimension

**When Acceptable:**
- Small multiples of pies showing change over time
- Very simple splits (2-3 categories)
- When exact proportions are less important than approximate sense

**Better Alternative:**
- Bar charts
- 100% stacked bars
- Simple table

#### Waterfall Charts - Highly Recommended

**Advantages:**
- Shows how you get from A to B
- Breaks down variance or change
- Cause-and-effect visualization
- Intuitive to read

**When to Use:**
- Variance analysis (Budget vs Actual)
- Period-to-period change
- Components building to total
- Bridge from one value to another

**Example:**
```
Start: 100
+ Increase A: +20
+ Increase B: +15
- Decrease C: -10
- Decrease D: -5
= End: 120
```

Visual shows floating bars building from 100 to 120.

### Chart Design Details

#### Column/Bar Width

**Recommendation:**
- Narrower columns/bars (about 1/3 of space)
- More white space between
- Easier to read
- Less visual weight
- Proportions are easier to judge

**Avoid:**
- Columns touching or nearly touching
- Bars taking up >50% of available space

#### Color Use

**Functional Colors Only:**
- Gray for non-highlighted data
- One accent color (typically orange, red, or blue) for highlighting
- Consistent meaning: AC=dark, BUD=light outline, FC=pattern
- Never use color arbitrarily

**Color for Categories:**
Only if categories have permanent color associations:
- Products with brand colors
- Regions with conventional colors
- Must be consistent across ALL charts

**Otherwise:**
Use form (solid, outline, pattern) rather than color to differentiate.

#### Value Labels

**When to Show:**
- Key values (end points, totals, peaks)
- When precision matters
- Alternative to y-axis scale

**How to Show:**
- At end of bar/column
- On the line (for line charts)
- Horizontal text always
- Sufficient contrast with background

**When to Omit:**
- Small values (clutter)
- When pattern is more important than exact values
- When accompanying table provides exact values

#### Scaling

**Key Principles:**

**1. Bars Must Start at Zero:**
- Otherwise proportions are misleading
- Bar length should represent value

**Exception:**
Variance bars (showing +/-) start at zero of the difference.

**2. Lines Can Start Above Zero:**
- When showing changes in continuous data
- Make the range clear
- Don't exaggerate small changes

**3. Consistent Scales:**
- When comparing similar charts, use same scale
- Enables visual comparison
- If scales must differ, make it obvious

**4. No Breaks in Axis:**
- "Cutting" the axis is manipulation
- Shows misleading proportions

**5. Appropriate Range:**
- Not too much white space
- Not cutting off peaks
- Show the full story

### Small Multiples

**Concept:**
Multiple small charts with the same structure showing different cuts of data.

**Advantages:**
- Instant pattern comparison
- High information density
- Consistent scales enable comparison
- More informative than one large chart

**Example:**
12 small charts showing sales trend for each of 12 products
- Same axes and scale
- Same time period
- Patterns immediately visible
- Outliers obvious

**When to Use:**
- Comparing same metric across categories
- Time series for multiple entities
- Regional comparisons
- Before/after comparisons

## Part XII: Report Objects - Tables (Tabellen)

### The Purpose of Tables

**Definition:**
Tables are structured arrangements of information in rows and columns.

**Purpose:**
- For reading, not seeing (in contrast to charts)
- Provide precise values
- Enable detailed comparison
- Offer reference information

**Key Principle:**
"Tables are for reading. Charts are for seeing."

**Message:**
Tables typically don't have a message (unless some aspect is highlighted). They are information offers, not arguments.

### Table Types

#### 1. Time Tables (Periodentabellen)

**Structure:**
- Time periods in columns
- Categories/items in rows
- Values at intersections

**Example:**
```
                2009    2010
Italy           802     788
Austria          49      34
UK              128     122
France          256     345
Rest            256     345
Europe        1,235   1,289
```

#### 2. Deviation Tables (Abweichungstabellen)

**Structure:**
- Shows comparisons (PY, ACT, ΔPY)
- Variance columns included
- Often includes percentages

**Example:**
```
                PY      ACT     ΔPY
Italy           802     788     -14
Austria          49      34     -15
UK              128     122      -6
France          256     345     +89
```

#### 3. Cross Tables (Kreuztabellen)

**Structure:**
- Two dimensions crossing
- Often show summary relationships

**Example:**
```
                Sales   Profit
Italy           802      45
Austria          49      12
UK              128      23
```

### Table Structure Elements

#### Headers (Tabellenköpfe)

**Complete Header Includes:**
- Organization unit
- Primary dimension (e.g., "by Countries")
- Secondary dimension (e.g., "and by Months")
- Measure and unit
- Time period
- Data types

**Example:**
"Alpha Corporation, Sales in EUR by Countries and by Months, Jan-Mar 2010"

**Different from Chart Titles:**
Tables specifically name the two main dimensions being crossed.

#### Column Types

**1. Base Columns:**
- Main data columns
- Typically ACT, BUD, PY, FC

**2. Variance Columns:**
- Calculated differences
- ΔPY, ΔBUD, ΔFC
- Absolute and/or percentage

**3. Scenario Columns:**
- Multiple scenarios shown
- Best case, base case, worst case
- Various forecasts

**Notation:**
- Consistent with charts
- ACT: Regular font, possibly bolded
- BUD: Often lighter or outlined
- Variances: Differentiated, often centered

#### Row Types

**1. Base Rows:**
- Individual items
- Detail level data

**2. Subtotal Rows:**
- Intermediate sums
- Subtly differentiated (e.g., light gray background)

**3. Total Rows:**
- Grand totals
- Strongly differentiated (e.g., dark background, bold, line above)

**Key Rule:**
**Totals always go below, not above.**

**Why:**
- Natural reading flow (detail → summary)
- Consistent with arithmetic (adding down to sum)
- Universal convention

### Table Design Principles

#### 1. Right-Align Numbers

**Rule:**
All numbers and their labels should be right-aligned.

**Why:**
- Decimal points align
- Easier to compare magnitude
- Natural for numeric reading
- Place values line up

**Exception:**
Left-aligned text labels in first column.

#### 2. Avoid Vertical Gridlines

**Rule:**
No vertical lines between columns (or very subtle if absolutely needed).

**Why:**
- Create visual noise
- White space is sufficient separation
- Horizontal lines sometimes useful, vertical rarely

**Alternative:**
- Subtle background shading
- Extra spacing between columns
- Strong alignment creates implied structure

#### 3. Highlight Sums

**Techniques:**
- Line above sum row
- Background shading (light gray)
- Bold font
- Slightly increased row height
- Combination of above

**Never:**
Just label "Total" or "Sum" - use visual differentiation.

#### 4. Consistent Column Width

**Guideline:**
- Columns with same data type should have same width
- Enables visual scanning
- Creates clean, professional appearance

**Example:**
All variance columns same width, all base data columns same width.

#### 5. Zebra Striping (Optional)

**Technique:**
Alternating row background shading (very subtle, typically white and very light gray).

**When Useful:**
- Tables with many rows
- Helps eye track across long rows
- Must be very subtle (barely perceptible)

**When Not:**
- Small tables
- When other grouping is more important

### Advanced Table Techniques

#### Integrated Visualizations

**Small Charts in Tables:**
- Sparklines (tiny line charts in cells)
- In-cell bars
- Bullet charts
- Icons and symbols

**Example:**
```
Country      Sales    Trend
Germany       802     ↗ [sparkline]
Austria        49     ↘ [sparkline]
UK            128     → [sparkline]
```

**Benefits:**
- Combines precision of tables with patterns of charts
- Very high information density
- Quick pattern recognition plus exact values

#### Conditional Formatting

**Color Scales:**
- Background color intensity based on value
- Heat map effect
- Instant identification of high/low values

**Icons:**
- Arrows for trends (↑ → ↓)
- Traffic lights for status (use sparingly!)
- Check marks for completion

**Data Bars:**
- Bar chart integrated into cell
- Value and visualization together

**Warning:**
Don't overuse - can become noise if applied to everything.

#### Multi-Level Headers

**When Needed:**
- Complex cross-tabulations
- Multiple dimensions
- Grouped columns

**Example:**
```
              2009            2010
          Q1    Q2        Q1    Q2
Product A  23    45        34    56
Product B  12    23        19    28
```

**Key:**
Clear hierarchy and grouping.

### Table Notation Consistency

**With Chart Notation:**
- Same colors for ACT, BUD, FC, PY
- Same use of borders and patterns
- Same treatment of variance
- Same number formatting

**Example:**
If ACT is dark gray in charts, ACT column in tables should also be emphasized (bold or slightly darker background).

### Common Table Mistakes

#### 1. Vertical Lines Everywhere

**Problem:**
Creates visual cage, hard to read.

**Solution:**
Remove all or most vertical lines, use white space.

#### 2. Inconsistent Number Formatting

**Problem:**
Some cells "1,234.56" others "1234.6" others "1,234.6"

**Solution:**
Uniform format throughout: "1 234" (space for thousands) "1.234 5" (period for decimal, space after 5th digit).

#### 3. Unsorted or Poorly Sorted

**Problem:**
Random order makes patterns hard to see.

**Solution:**
- Sort by importance (alphabetically, by size, by region)
- Consistent sorting logic
- Group related items

#### 4. Too Much Color

**Problem:**
Rainbow tables with every row a different color.

**Solution:**
- Functional color only
- Mostly grayscale
- Color for highlighting only

#### 5. Decimal Overload

**Problem:**
"23.457892%" when "23%" or "23.5%" would suffice.

**Solution:**
- 3 significant figures maximum
- Appropriate precision for the context
- Consistency within a table

### Tables vs. Charts: When to Use Which

**Use Tables When:**
- Exact values are important
- Many data points (100+)
- Reference document
- Audit trail needed
- Multi-dimensional detailed comparison

**Use Charts When:**
- Patterns and trends matter more than exact values
- Visual comparison
- Presentation to audience
- Emphasizing a message
- Quick insight desired

**Use Both When:**
- Chart shows pattern
- Table provides exact reference
- Small integrated chart with table
- Or table and chart side by side

## Part XIII: Report Objects - Text (Texte)

### The Purpose of Text in Reports

**Definition:**
Text provides explanations, context, interpretations, and recommendations that numbers alone cannot convey.

**Key Principle:**
"Reports should report something" - this requires text, not just tables and charts.

**Purpose:**
- Explain what the data means
- Provide context and background
- State conclusions and recommendations
- Connect data points into a narrative
- Make arguments based on evidence

### Text is Not Optional

**The Problem:**
Many "reports" today consist only of:
- PowerPoint bullet points
- Tables of numbers
- Charts without explanation
- Assembled data without narrative

**The Reality:**
These are not reports - they are data compilations or statistics. A report requires text that actually reports something.

**The Solution:**
Text should be the primary component, with tables and charts supporting the textual narrative.

### Message-First Writing

**The Principle:**
State your conclusion first, then provide supporting details.

**Example: Lucy's Letter (from Gene Zelazny)**

**Bad Structure - Message at End:**
```
Hello Shirley,

Do you remember last Saturday when I was playing with my friend in the park and you came over and he told me that you kissed him when I just turned my back?

And last Sunday when you visited me and my mother made tuna salad for lunch and you said: "Yuck, that's the most disgusting salad I've ever eaten"?

And yesterday when my cat brushed against your leg and you kicked her and threatened to set your dog Monster on her?

Well, for these reasons I hate you, and I don't want to be your friend anymore.

Lucy
```

**Good Structure - Message First:**
```
Hello Shirley,

I hate you.

And here are my reasons:
1. You stole my friend
2. You insulted my mother
3. You scared my cat

Lucy
```

**Why This Works:**
- Reader knows immediately what the message is
- Can decide whether to read details
- Respects reader's time
- Details support, don't build to, the conclusion

### Text Structure in Reports

#### 1. Executive Summary

**Position:**
At the very beginning, before any detail.

**Content:**
- Main findings or recommendations
- Key insights
- Critical decisions needed
- 1-2 pages maximum
- Complete sentences, not bullets

**Test:**
Can busy executive read only this and understand key points?

#### 2. Section Introductions

**Each Major Section Should Start With:**
- Summary of what this section covers
- Key finding or conclusion from this section
- Why this section matters

**Then:**
- Supporting details
- Analysis
- Data presentations

#### 3. Chart and Table Accompaniment

**For Each Significant Chart/Table:**
- Reference it explicitly in text
- Explain what it shows
- Interpret the meaning
- Connect to your argument

**Example:**
"As shown in Figure 3, sales declined in all three regions. The steepest decline was in the North Region (-22%), primarily due to the closure of two major retail partners. This decline could not be offset by growth in the South Region (+5%)."

### Writing Principles

#### 1. Complete Sentences

**Avoid:**
- Bullet points as sentence fragments
- Incomplete thoughts
- "Telegraphic" style

**Use:**
- Full sentences with subject, verb, object
- Clear statements
- Logical connections between sentences

#### 2. Precise Language

**Vague → Precise:**

**Vague:**
"Relevant cost cut"
**Precise:**
"Cost reduction of 3.5 million EUR"

**Vague:**
"Around 100 units"
**Precise:**
"Between 98 and 102 units"

**Vague:**
"Significant deviation"
**Precise:**
"Deviation of +9% from budget"

**Vague:**
"More than 5 tons"
**Precise:**
"6 or 7 tons"

**Vague:**
"Much better than plan"
**Precise:**
"3% above plan"

#### 3. Standard Terminology

**Use a Glossary:**
Maintain consistent definitions for all terms.

**Example Glossary Entry:**
| Term | Short | Long | Abbreviation | Definition |
|------|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| Return on Investment | Ret. on inv. | Return on Investment | ROI | ROI is defined as EBIT/Capital Employed × 100 |
| Accounts Receivable | Acc. receiv. | Accounts Receivable | AR | Trade receivables from customers, excluding notes receivable |

**Benefits:**
- Consistent usage across reports
- Clear communication
- Defined calculations
- Multilingual support

#### 4. Avoid Redundancy

**Don't:**
- Repeat what's already in the table/chart
- State the obvious ("Sales in EUR are shown in EUR")
- Redundant adjectives ("total sum," "complete total")

**Do:**
- Interpret and explain
- Add context not visible in the visualization
- Connect multiple data points
- Draw conclusions

#### 5. Active Voice

**Weak (Passive):**
"The decision was made to close the factory."

**Strong (Active):**
"Management decided to close the factory."

**Weak:**
"Mistakes were made."

**Strong:**
"The project team made three critical mistakes."

**Why Active is Better:**
- Clearer who is responsible
- More direct
- Easier to understand
- More engaging

### Text Layout

#### Paragraph Structure

**Topic Sentence First:**
Each paragraph should start with its main point.

**Supporting Sentences:**
Then provide evidence, examples, details.

**Transition or Conclusion:**
End with connection to next paragraph or summary.

**Example:**
"The decline in European sales stems from three factors. First, the Euro's weakness against the dollar reduced our price competitiveness by 8%. Second, two major retail partners went bankrupt, eliminating 15% of our distribution capacity. Third, our product refresh was delayed six months, allowing competitors to gain market share. Together, these factors explain the 22% year-over-year decline in the region."

#### Formatting

**Use Headers:**
Clear hierarchy of headers helps navigation:
- H1: Major sections
- H2: Subsections
- H3: Sub-subsections

**Use Lists:**
- When presenting parallel items
- For steps in a process
- For multiple factors or reasons
- Keep items grammatically parallel

**Use White Space:**
- Paragraph breaks between distinct ideas
- Line spacing for readability
- Margins for professional appearance

**Font Choices:**
- Sans-serif (Arial, Calibri, Helvetica) for reports
- 11-12pt for body text
- Consistent throughout

### Integrating Text with Visuals

#### Reference System

**Number All Objects:**
- Figure 1, Figure 2, etc.
- Table 1, Table 2, etc.
- Clear numbering system

**Reference in Text:**
"As shown in Figure 3..." "Table 5 presents..." "See Figure 8 for details."

**Captions:**
Each figure and table should have:
- Number
- Title
- Brief caption if needed
- Source reference

#### Positioning

**Ideal:**
Visual appears close to where it's referenced in text.

**Options:**
- Inline: Visual embedded in text flow
- Right margin: Text wraps around visual
- Full width: Visual spans page width, text above and below
- Appendix: Detailed visuals referenced but not inline

### Special Text Forms

#### Management Commentary

**Purpose:**
Explain variations, trends, and actions.

**Structure:**
1. State what happened
2. Explain why
3. Describe what's being done about it

**Example:**
"Q3 profits declined 12% vs. Q2. This was driven by seasonal maintenance shutdowns (6% impact) and delayed customer payments extending DSO by 8 days (4% impact). We have implemented accelerated collection procedures and brought forward Q4 maintenance to avoid year-end surprises."

#### Recommendation Format

**Clear Structure:**
- **Recommendation:** What should be done
- **Rationale:** Why (3-5 key reasons)
- **Implications:** What happens if we do/don't
- **Next Steps:** How to implement

**Example:**
"**Recommendation:** Exit the Product X line by Q2 2024.

**Rationale:**
- Margin has declined to 3% vs. company average of 18%
- Market share dropped from 25% to 8% over three years
- Two major competitors have entered with superior technology
- Internal resources would be better deployed to Product Y

**Implications:** Short-term revenue loss of ~$5M will be offset by cost savings of $8M annually and freeing capacity for higher-margin products.

**Next Steps:** Detailed wind-down plan by Jan 15, customer migration program by Feb 1."

### Text Mistakes to Avoid

#### 1. Throat-Clearing

**Bad:**
"In order to better understand the current situation and provide relevant context for the analysis that follows, it is important to first review the historical background of the industry and consider the various factors that have contributed to..."

**Good:**
"Sales declined 15% due to three competitive factors."

**Fix:**
Get to the point immediately.

#### 2. Saying Nothing

**Bad:**
"The situation is complex and various factors are at play. Multiple stakeholders have different perspectives. Going forward, we will continue to monitor developments."

**Good:**
"We recommend closing the Munich facility by June due to high costs and low utilization. This will save $2M annually."

**Fix:**
Make specific, substantive statements.

#### 3. Hiding in Bullets

**Bad:**
```
• Situation complex
• Various factors
• Multiple perspectives
• Continue monitoring
```

**Good:**
"Despite the complexity, we have identified three root causes. We recommend addressing them through the following interventions..."

**Fix:**
Use complete sentences that form arguments.

#### 4. Inconsistent Terminology

**Bad:**
Using "Revenue," "Sales," "Turnover," "Top Line" interchangeably.

**Good:**
Pick one term (usually "Sales" or "Revenue") and use it consistently.

**Fix:**
Maintain glossary and stick to it.

## Part XIV: Report Objects - Graphics and Other Elements

### Non-Quantitative Graphics (Grafiken)

**Definition:**
Visual representations that don't primarily show numerical data.

**Types:**
- Network diagrams
- Process flows
- Organization charts
- Maps
- Decision trees
- Mind maps
- Illustrations and photos

**Purpose:**
Like charts, graphics should support the message, not just decorate.

### When to Use Graphics

**Appropriate Uses:**
- Showing relationships that aren't quantitative
- Illustrating processes or workflows
- Depicting geographic information
- Clarifying organizational structures
- Showing systems and their connections

**Poor Uses:**
- Generic clip art for decoration
- Stock photos that don't add information
- Complex graphics that are hard to understand
- Graphics that require extensive explanation

### Principles for Graphics

#### 1. Same Notation Consistency

**Rule:**
Graphics should follow the same notation principles as charts and tables.

**Examples:**
- If rounded borders mean "actual" in charts, use them the same way in process diagrams
- If color coding is used for regions, apply it consistently in maps
- Same fonts and visual language throughout

#### 2. Clear Purpose

**Every Graphic Should:**
- Have a clear title
- Convey specific information
- Support the text message
- Be referenced in the text

**Avoid:**
- Decorative graphics
- Generic illustrations
- Unneeded complexity

#### 3. Professional Simplicity

**Good Graphics:**
- Clean, simple design
- Clear labels
- Functional color use
- Easy to understand quickly

**Avoid:**
- Excessive detail
- Cluttered layouts
- Gratuitous 3D effects
- Overdesign

### Specific Graphic Types

#### Maps

**Best Practices:**
- Clear geographic boundaries
- Consistent color/pattern notation
- Legend if needed (but direct labeling better)
- Scale appropriate to information

**Example from Hichert PDF:**
Charles Minard's famous map of Napoleon's Russian campaign - combining:
- Geography
- Troop numbers (line width)
- Direction (color and arrows)
- Temperature (graph below)
- Time progression

**Shows:**
How high information density in a graphic can tell a powerful story.

#### Organization Charts

**Best Practices:**
- Clear hierarchy
- Consistent box sizes/shapes for same levels
- Readable names and titles
- Not too many levels shown at once

**Options:**
- Full names or just titles
- Photos or no photos
- Vertical or horizontal orientation

#### Process Flows

**Best Practices:**
- Left-to-right or top-to-bottom flow
- Consistent shapes for different step types
- Clear decision points
- Minimal crossing lines

**Swim Lanes:**
Can show different actors/departments in parallel lanes.

#### Network Diagrams

**Best Practices:**
- Clear node labels
- Relationship types indicated
- Avoid "spaghetti" tangles
- Group related elements

### Other Objects

#### Ordering Elements

**Page Numbers:**
- Consistent position
- Clear format
- Helpful for reference

**Headers/Footers:**
- Report name/date
- Section indicators
- Company identification
- Confidentiality notices

**Frames and Borders:**
- Only if they convey meaning
- Consistent use
- Subtle, not dominating

#### Highlighting Elements

**Trend Arrows:**
- Up/down/sideways
- Consistent meaning
- Standard sizes
- Positioned consistently

**Variance Markers:**
- Plus/minus indicators
- Delta symbols (Δ)
- Color coding
- Consistent placement

**Circles and Underlining:**
- To draw attention to key elements
- Support message highlighting
- Used sparingly
- Consistent style

**Symbols:**
- Warning symbols
- Status indicators
- Check marks
- Standardized meaning

### Corporate Design vs. Information Design

**The Tension:**

**Corporate Design Focuses On:**
- Brand identity
- Visual appeal
- Consistency with marketing
- Differentiation from competitors

**Information Design Focuses On:**
- Clarity
- Quick comprehension
- Functional elements only
- Standardized notation

**The Problem:**
Misunderstood corporate design often:
- Wastes space with oversized logos
- Adds decorative elements that obscure information
- Uses colors for branding rather than meaning
- Creates "noise" in reports

**The Solution:**
- Minimal branding in internal reports
- Functional use of corporate colors
- Logo small and unobtrusive
- Standard information notation takes precedence

**Hichert's Position:**
Corporate design should serve understanding, not override it. Management reports are not marketing materials.

## Part XV: The 119 SUCCESS Rules

### Overview

Hichert has formalized the SUCCESS principles into 119 specific, actionable rules. These are presented in the SUCCESS Poster, a comprehensive visual reference.

**Organization:**
The 119 rules are organized under the seven SUCCESS categories, with multiple levels of detail:

### Rule Numbering System

## Part XVII: Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Chart Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Pie Chart for Everything

**Problem:**
Using pie charts when other visualizations would be more effective.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Hard to compare slice sizes
- Can't show time dimension
- Takes up too much space
- Limited to showing one dimension

**Solution:**
- Bar chart for comparison
- Line chart for time series
- Table for precision
- Pie only for very simple proportions (2-3 categories)

#### Mistake 2: 3D for Decoration

**Problem:**
3D bars, pies, etc. without any third dimension of data.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Distorts perception
- Harder to read accurately
- No additional information
- Looks unprofessional

**Solution:**
2D visualization unless genuinely showing three dimensions of data.

#### Mistake 3: Cut Axes

**Problem:**
Bar chart with y-axis starting at non-zero (e.g., 70-80 instead of 0-80).

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Exaggerates differences
- Misleading proportions
- Manipulative appearance

**Solution:**
- Bars must start at zero
- If you want to emphasize change, use a variance chart
- Or use a line chart for continuous data

#### Mistake 4: Inconsistent Colors

**Problem:**
Using different colors for the same category across charts, or using color arbitrarily.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- No visual consistency
- Can't compare across pages
- Cognitive load interpreting each chart anew

**Solution:**
Establish color meanings (ACT=dark, BUD=outline, etc.) and apply consistently.

#### Mistake 5: Legends Instead of Direct Labels

**Problem:**
Color-coded legend requiring eye movement back and forth.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Breaks reading flow
- Slower comprehension
- Easy to misassociate colors

**Solution:**
Direct labeling of all series.

### Table Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Vertical Line Prison

**Problem:**
Heavy gridlines between every column and row.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Creates visual cage
- Harder to read
- Unprofessional appearance

**Solution:**
Remove vertical lines, minimal horizontal lines, use white space.

#### Mistake 2: Random Number Formatting

**Problem:**
Mixing formats (1,234.56 with 1234.6 with 1.234,56).

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Confusing
- Unprofessional
- Hard to compare

**Solution:**
Consistent format: "1 234" (space for thousands) throughout.

#### Mistake 3: Too Much Precision

**Problem:**
"47.38276%" when "47%" would suffice.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- False precision
- Clutter
- Distracts from pattern

**Solution:**
3 significant figures maximum, appropriate to context.

#### Mistake 4: Unsorted Tables

**Problem:**
Random order with no sorting logic.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Hard to find items
- Patterns not visible
- Unprofessional

**Solution:**
Sort by meaningful dimension (size, alphabet, region, importance).

### Text Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Bullet Point Reports

**Problem:**
Entire report is bullet points and incomplete sentences.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- No arguments, just lists
- Doesn't actually report anything
- No logical connections
- Hard to understand implications

**Solution:**
Complete sentences forming arguments, bullets only for genuine lists.

#### Mistake 2: Burying the Lead

**Problem:**
Long buildup with conclusion at the end.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Reader doesn't know where it's going
- Wastes time
- Key insights hidden

**Solution:**
Message first, then supporting details (Lucy's letter principle).

#### Mistake 3: Vague Language

**Problem:**
"Significant improvement" "Around 100" "Recently"

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Not verifiable
- Unclear meaning
- Unprofessional

**Solution:**
Precise: "Increase of 3.5 million EUR" "Between 98-102" "On March 15"

#### Mistake 4: Redundancy with Visuals

**Problem:**
Text just repeats what's in the table/chart.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Wastes space
- No added value
- Boring

**Solution:**
Text should interpret, explain, and connect, not repeat.

### Presentation Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Reading Slides

**Problem:**
Presenter reads what's on the slides word for word.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Audience can read faster than presenter speaks
- Presenter adds no value
- Boring and disrespectful

**Solution:**
Slides show visuals and key points, presenter provides explanation and insights.

#### Mistake 2: Slides as Handouts

**Problem:**
Trying to make slides work both projected and as printed handouts.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Too much text on slides
- Not enough detail for handouts
- Compromises both functions

**Solution:**
Separate slide deck and handout document.

#### Mistake 3: No Clear Message

**Problem:**
Presentation is just "sharing information" with no clear point.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Audience doesn't know what to take away
- No call to action
- Nothing happens after presentation

**Solution:**
Clear message that can be stated in one sentence, explicit next steps.

#### Mistake 4: Animation Overload

**Problem:**
Every element flies, dissolves, bounces, or rotates.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Distracting
- Wastes time
- Looks unprofessional
- Focuses attention on effects, not content

**Solution:**
No transitions, or at most simple fade. Content > spectacle.

### Structural Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Not MECE

**Problem:**
Overlapping categories or gaps in coverage.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Double-counting
- Missing items
- Unclear structure
- Confusing

**Solution:**
Apply MECE principles rigorously.

#### Mistake 2: Mixed Levels

**Problem:**
Combining high-level and detailed items in same list.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Not homogeneous
- Confusing hierarchy
- Unprofessional

**Solution:**
Keep each level of structure consistent (homogeneous).

#### Mistake 3: Poor Hierarchy

**Problem:**
Flat structure with no grouping, or too many levels.

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Hard to navigate
- Patterns not visible
- Overwhelming

**Solution:**
3-5 items per level, appropriate depth (usually 2-4 levels).

#background: Rolf Hichert studied mechanical engineering in Stuttgart, earned his doctorate in mechanical engineering while working for the Fraunhofer Institute for Production Technology and Automation, and joined McKinsey & Company in the 1980s where he met thought leaders like Gene Zelazny and developed his interest in professional visualizations. In the early 1980s he worked as a professor in the IT department at the University of Applied Sciences in Constance, Germany, teaching marketing and project management. From 2004, he dedicated himself full-time to developing standardized approaches to business communication, believing that business reports should be as universally understandable as musical scores or circuit diagrams. He co-founded Hichert+Partner with Jürgen Faisst, published the SUCCESS Rules in 2008, and in 2013 transferred his intellectual property to the newly founded IBCS Association under a Creative Commons license. Today he serves as president of the IBCS Association and is recognized as one of the leading luminaries in data visualization for business communication.
