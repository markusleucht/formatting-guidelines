# Things I Believe

## Shipping fast beats the best strategy

- Speed is a [superpower](https://x.com/thejamescad/status/1929324444176044047)
- Create a bias toward shipping
- Small teams ship faster
- [AI-native](https://x.com/leerob/status/1929727742821413331) teams will move 10x faster than those not willing to change
- Landings > launches (i.e. product adoption > shipping code)
- Listen, build, ship, tell the customer, then repeat forever

## You have no career ceiling

- Grit > talent
- There's no substitute for [putting in the hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDyg_41QF1w)
- Get [1% better](https://x.com/leerob/status/1841226051554308229) every day

## Be ruthlessly truth seeking

- The truth can be painful
- You can just change your mind if wrong
- Have strong opinions, loosely held
- Maximize your [exposure hours](https://articles.centercentre.com/user_exposure_hours/)
- "Anecdata" > data
- Seek the collective truth, not just [one opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem)

## Communication is the job

- [Clear writing](https://paulgraham.com/talk.html) is clear thinking
- Everyone (yes, you) needs to become a [better writer](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html)
- Leaders step up to provide clarity when absent
- Be the person taking notes, even if it's just for yourself
- Mismatched expectations lead to sadness
- Slack pro tip: anticipate objections before hitting send, then [address them](https://newsletter.weskao.com/p/super-specific-feedback)

## Education is the best form of developer marketing

- Be authentic and own your failures
- Never use the word "webinar" ever again
- Being helpful compounds

## Leadership means owning outcomes beyond the org chart

- Influence > titles
- Leaders have to do the work themselves *and* delegate
- You can write your own playbook
- Study what worked for others, then take your own path

## Work can also be your hobby

- This doesn't mean you can't have other hobbies
- Passion + boundaries > mythical "work-life balance"
- Your best work comes from following your curiosity

## Demos > memos

- You could have built a prototype in [v0](https://v0.dev/) during the meeting
- Only ship things you're [excited about yourself](https://x.com/rauchg/status/1932126547609334017)

## Hiring is what separates good leaders from great

- There are two hiring answers: [hell yes](https://sive.rs/n) or no
- Growth potential > current skill
- Hire people you can learn from
- Hire people you would someday be happy working for
- Favorite interview question: what work are you most proud of?

## Always try to assume good intent

- Lead with empathy
- They might just be having a bad day
- Criticism is good feedback if you listen unemotionally
