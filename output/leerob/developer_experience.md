# On Developer Experience

Developer Experience (DX) is about building products developers "love to use."

## 1. Documentation

Docs make or break developer products.

They must be high-quality and available everywhere: on your website, in their editor, and inside AI chatbots. Your goal is write content beginners can understand and experts appreciate.

[Here's all my notes](/docs) on how to build great docs.

## 2. Community

Building community is a long-term investment. It must be in your company DNA.

It's *not* a collection of developers you are trying to sell your product to. It's an "exchange." They share bugs, *you fix them*. They submit pull requests, *you merge and encourage them*.

This is how you understand what's working (or not working) with your product. Their feedback shapes the product direction and roadmap.

A community forms around a product when developers feel heard. They share their wins and frustrations, and you respond by improving the product or clarifying the docs. You must meet developers where they already are: GitHub, X, Reddit, Slack, or at meetups.

**Suggestions:**

- You can't spend too much time talking to developers in the community.
- Make yourself accessible to answer questions (e.g. host an AMA).
- Monitor feedback on social media to understand community sentiment.
- Use a Slackbot to send realtime user feedback to product teams.
- Invest in high-quality swag for your top community members.
- Everybody loves stickers. They cheap and easy to buy in bulk.

## 3. Education

"Education is the best form of marketing, second only to customer testimonials."

Good education not only shows people *how* to use your product but *why* it exists and *what* they can accomplish with it. It's part storytelling, part technical guide, part product demo.

**Suggestions:**

- Build demos that show real-world usage of your product (not just hello world).
- If you answer the same question multiple times, turn it into a guide.
- You need both reference material (docs) and structured learning (courses).
