## Part I: Core Principles

### The Three Commandments

The Economist's approach to writing rests on three fundamental principles:

#### 1. Clarity Above All

**The Prime Directive:**
- The first duty is to be clear
- Never make the reader work unnecessarily
- If something can be misunderstood, it will be
- Complexity of thought doesn't require complexity of expression

**In Practice:**
- Use simple words over complex ones
- Prefer short sentences to long
- Break up dense paragraphs
- Put the important information first
- One main idea per sentence

**Test Your Clarity:**
- Can a intelligent non-specialist understand this?
- Have I used any word unnecessarily?
- Could I say this more simply?

#### 2. Precision in Everything

**Be Exact:**
- Choose the word that means exactly what you mean
- Avoid approximations when specifics are available
- Don't say "many" when you mean "37%"
- Don't say "recently" when you mean "on March 15th"
- Don't say "rose" when it "jumped" or "edged up"

**Precision in Claims:**
- Distinguish between fact and opinion
- Attribute sources accurately
- Qualify appropriately (some, many, most, all)
- Be precise about causation (caused, contributed to, correlated with)

**Numbers Matter:**
- Always give context for numbers
- Use the right level of precision (don't say 47.3% when 47% suffices)
- Make comparisons meaningful
- Explain what numbers mean

#### 3. Brevity is Respect

**Cut Ruthlessly:**
- The Economist has no space for unnecessary words
- Every word must earn its place
- Long articles are easy to write; short ones take work
- Respect the reader's time

**In Practice:**
- Delete adjectives that don't add meaning
- Eliminate redundant phrases
- Cut throat-clearing openings
- Remove obvious transitions
- Pare qualifiers and hedges

**Common Cuts:**
- "In order to" → "to"
- "Due to the fact that" → "because"
- "At this point in time" → "now"
- "A number of" → "some" or "several"
- "In the event that" → "if"

### The Reader-First Approach

**Everything Serves the Reader:**
- Write for busy, intelligent people
- Assume they're smart but not specialist
- Don't condescend, but don't assume knowledge
- Give context efficiently
- Make the payoff clear

**The Inverted Pyramid:**
- Most important information first
- Supporting details follow
- Background comes after the news
- Reader should get the point in the first paragraph

---

## Part II: The Economist Voice

### Authority Without Arrogance

The Economist has a distinctive voice: confident but not cocky, authoritative but not authoritarian, opinionated but not shrill.

#### Confident Humility

**Be Confident:**
- Take clear positions
- Make judgments when warranted
- Don't hide behind weasel words
- Say what you think

**But Stay Humble:**
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Admit when things are unclear
- Present counterarguments fairly
- Update views when facts change

**Avoid:**
- "It could be argued that..." (Just argue it)
- "Some might say..." (Who? Do you agree?)
- "Arguably" (Is it arguable or not?)

**Examples:**

**Weak:** "It might be suggested that the policy was misguided"
**Strong:** "The policy was misguided"

**Weak:** "There are those who believe the company will fail"
**Strong:** "The company will probably fail" (if that's your view)

#### Objectivity and Opinion

**The Balance:**
- Report facts objectively
- Separate fact from opinion clearly
- When you opine, do so clearly and confidently
- Support opinions with evidence

**In News:**
- Stick to facts
- Attribute opinions to sources
- Present multiple viewpoints fairly
- Let readers draw conclusions

**In Analysis:**
- Take positions
- Make judgments
- Support with evidence
- Acknowledge complexity

#### Wit and Intelligence

**The Economist's Personality:**
- Dry wit is welcome
- Clever wordplay when apt
- Never at the expense of clarity
- Humor should illuminate, not obscure

**Good Wit:**
- Illuminates the point
- Adds insight
- Feels effortless
- Respects the subject

**Bad Wit:**
- Strains for effect
- Obscures meaning
- Shows off
- Disrespects serious topics

---

## Part III: Grammar and Syntax

### Sentence Construction

#### Keep Sentences Short

**The Standard:**
- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Vary length for rhythm
- Long sentences (25+ words) need careful construction
- Very long sentences (35+ words) are usually a mistake

**Breaking Long Sentences:**
- Find the natural breaks
- Use periods liberally
- Semi-colons can help but don't overuse
- Each sentence should make one point

**Example Revision:**

**Too Long:**
"The company, which was founded in 1995 by two Stanford graduates who had previously worked at Microsoft and Oracle respectively, announced yesterday that it would be laying off 15% of its workforce as part of a broader restructuring effort that the CEO said was necessary to focus on the firm's core business in cloud computing while exiting several less profitable divisions."

**Better:**
"The company announced yesterday that it would lay off 15% of its workforce. The cuts are part of a broader restructuring. The CEO said the firm needs to focus on its core cloud-computing business and exit less profitable divisions. Two Stanford graduates founded the company in 1995."

#### Active Voice

**Prefer Active Construction:**
- Active voice is clearer and stronger
- It specifies who does what
- Passive voice obscures agency

**Active vs. Passive:**

**Passive:** "The decision was made to close the factory"
**Active:** "Management decided to close the factory"

**Passive:** "Mistakes were made"
**Active:** "The president made mistakes"

**When Passive is Acceptable:**
- When the actor is unknown or unimportant
- "The building was destroyed" (doesn't matter by whom)
- When you want to emphasize the object
- "CRISPR was developed in 2012"

#### Put Important Information First

**Front-Load Sentences:**
- Main point before qualifications
- Action before background
- News before context

**Examples:**

**Weak:** "Despite recent economic challenges, the company reported strong profits"
**Strong:** "The company reported strong profits despite recent economic challenges"

**Weak:** "After years of debate, the parliament finally passed the reform"
**Strong:** "Parliament passed the reform after years of debate"

### Common Grammar Rules

#### Subject-Verb Agreement

**The Basics:**
- Singular subjects take singular verbs
- Plural subjects take plural verbs
- Watch for intervening phrases

**Tricky Cases:**

**Collective Nouns:**
- Use singular when acting as unit: "The company is"
- Use plural when acting as individuals: "The staff are divided"

**Neither/Nor:**
- Verb agrees with nearest subject
- "Neither the CEO nor the directors were present"

**Each, Every, Everyone:**
- Always singular
- "Each of the companies has its own approach"

#### Pronoun Agreement

**Match Number:**
- Singular antecedent = singular pronoun
- Plural antecedent = plural pronoun

**The "They" Solution:**
- The Economist accepts singular "they" for non-binary individuals
- Also useful to avoid "he or she" constructions
- "Every writer should trust their instincts"

#### Modifiers and Danglers

**Avoid Dangling Modifiers:**

**Wrong:** "Walking down the street, the building caught my eye"
(The building wasn't walking)

**Right:** "Walking down the street, I noticed the building"

**Watch Placement:**
- Modifiers should be close to what they modify
- "Only" is frequently misplaced

**Ambiguous:** "The CEO only spoke to analysts yesterday"
**Clear:** "The CEO spoke only to analysts yesterday" (not to others)
**Clear:** "The CEO spoke to analysts only yesterday" (not before)

---

## Part IV: Punctuation

### The Comma

#### Use Commas Sparingly

**The Economist Approach:**
- Fewer commas than many style guides
- Only use when necessary for clarity or rhythm
- Don't use before "and" in simple series (British style)

**Series (No Oxford Comma):**
- "The firm sells cars, trucks and motorcycles"
- Exception: when needed for clarity
- "The menu included beef, chicken, and ham and cheese sandwiches"

#### Essential Comma Rules

**After Introductory Phrases:**
- "In 2024, the company expanded"
- "Despite the challenges, profits rose"

**Around Non-Essential Clauses:**
- "The CEO, who joined in 2020, announced reforms"
- But not: "The CEO who joined in 2020 announced reforms" (if there are multiple CEOs)

**Before Conjunctions in Compound Sentences:**
- "The market rose, and investors celebrated"
- But not: "The market rose and investors celebrated" (if same subject)

### The Semicolon

**Two Main Uses:**

**1. Linking Related Independent Clauses:**
- "The company grew rapidly; profits doubled in three years"
- Use when sentences are closely related
- Don't overuse

**2. Complex Series:**
- When items contain commas
- "The firm operates in Paris, France; Berlin, Germany; and Rome, Italy"

### The Dash

**Two Types:**

**Em Dash (—):**
- For parenthetical remarks
- "The CEO—who is 35—is the youngest in the industry"
- Use sparingly
- The Economist prefers parentheses for most asides

**En Dash (–):**
- For ranges: "2020–2024"
- Not "from 2020–2024" (use "from 2020 to 2024")
- Between related elements: "The US–China relationship"

### The Colon

**Main Uses:**

**1. Introducing a List:**
- "The reforms include three elements: tax cuts, deregulation and spending limits"

**2. Introducing an Explanation:**
- "The reason is clear: costs have risen faster than revenues"

**Not After "Is" or "Are":**
- Wrong: "The three priorities are: growth, efficiency and innovation"
- Right: "The three priorities are growth, efficiency and innovation"
- Or: "There are three priorities: growth, efficiency and innovation"

### Quotation Marks

**The Economist Style (British):**
- Single quotes for quotations
- Double quotes for quotes within quotes
- 'The CEO said the outlook was "challenging".'

**Punctuation Placement:**
- Logical placement (British style)
- Periods and commas outside quotes unless part of quoted material
- 'The report described the results as "disappointing".'

**Scare Quotes:**
- Use sparingly
- Only when distancing from a term or showing irony
- Don't use for emphasis (never "important")

---

## Part V: Word Choice

### Simplicity Over Sophistication

#### Prefer Simple Words

**The Rule:**
- Never use a long word when a short one will do
- Don't use "utilise" when you mean "use"
- Don't use "commence" when you mean "start"
- Don't use "endeavour" when you mean "try"

**Common Offenders:**

**Complex → Simple**
- Facilitate → help
- Implement → carry out / do
- Methodology → method
- Optimise → improve
- Prior to → before
- Purchase → buy
- Terminate → end
- Utilise → use

#### Avoid Jargon

**Business Jargon to Avoid:**
- Leverage (unless about debt)
- Synergy
- Circle back
- Deep dive
- Move the needle
- Low-hanging fruit
- Paradigm shift
- Touch base

**When Technical Terms are Necessary:**
- Define them clearly
- Explain on first use
- Consider whether readers really need the term
- Use consistently once introduced

**Example:**
"Quantitative easing (printing money to buy bonds) helped boost the economy"

#### Avoid Clichés

**Tired Phrases to Avoid:**
- At the end of the day
- Going forward
- Push the envelope
- Think outside the box
- Tip of the iceberg
- Level playing field
- Wake-up call
- Game changer
- Perfect storm

**Why Avoid Them:**
- They're tired
- They're imprecise
- They show lazy thinking
- They don't add meaning

#### Be Specific

**Vague → Precise:**
- Recently → last week / on March 15th
- Soon → by June / in three months
- Large → 40% / $5 billion
- Many → most / 73% / hundreds
- Significant → important / substantial / notable (be specific)

**Choose Precise Verbs:**
- Not "said" for everything
- Said, stated, claimed, argued, insisted, admitted, conceded
- But don't strain for variation
- "Said" is often best

### Words That Confuse

#### Commonly Misused Words

**Affect vs. Effect:**
- Affect (verb): to influence
- Effect (noun): a result
- Effect (verb): to bring about
- "The policy affected the market and had a positive effect"

**Imply vs. Infer:**
- Imply: suggest indirectly (speaker does this)
- Infer: deduce from evidence (listener does this)
- "The CEO implied costs would rise; investors inferred profits would fall"

**Comprise vs. Compose:**
- The whole comprises the parts
- The parts compose the whole
- "The board comprises ten members" (not "is comprised of")
- Or better: "The board has ten members"

**Less vs. Fewer:**
- Fewer: countable items (fewer cars)
- Less: mass nouns (less traffic)
- "Fewer people, less time"

**That vs. Which:**
- That: introduces essential clause (no comma)
- Which: introduces non-essential clause (comma)
- "The car that I bought is blue" (specifies which car)
- "My car, which is blue, needs repairs" (adds information)

**Further vs. Farther:**
- Farther: physical distance
- Further: metaphorical distance, additional
- "He walked farther down the road to further his investigation"

---

## Part VI: Numbers and Data

### Presenting Numbers Clearly

#### Always Give Context

**Make Numbers Meaningful:**
- Compare to something
- Explain significance
- Put in perspective
- Don't leave readers guessing

**Examples:**

**Weak:** "The company earned $500 million"
**Better:** "The company earned $500 million, up 20% from last year"
**Best:** "The company earned $500 million, up 20% from last year and its highest profit in a decade"

#### Rounding and Precision

**Don't Over-Specify:**
- Use appropriate precision
- "About 50%" not "47.3%" if the precision doesn't matter
- "Nearly $1 billion" not "$947.3 million" in most contexts
- Round when it aids comprehension

**When to Be Precise:**
- Financial statements
- Scientific data
- When the precision matters
- When readers need exact figures

#### Large Numbers

**Use Helpful Units:**
- Billion and trillion for large numbers
- "$5 billion" not "$5,000 million"
- "5m tonnes" not "5,000,000 tonnes"

**Abbreviations:**
- m for million
- bn for billion
- trn for trillion
- Use consistently

**Be Careful With:**
- British vs. American billions (now standardized to 10^9)
- Currency conversions
- Inflation adjustments

#### Percentages and Changes

**Be Clear About Base:**
- "Rose from 20% to 30%" is clear
- "Rose by 10 percentage points" is clear
- "Rose by 50%" (from 20% to 30%) is confusing

**Percentage vs. Percentage Points:**
- Distinguish clearly
- "Interest rates rose by 2 percentage points, from 3% to 5%"
- Not "rose by 2%"

**Changes in Percentages:**
- Be especially careful
- "Unemployment rose from 5% to 10%" = rose 5 percentage points = doubled
- Avoid "rose 100%"

#### Dates and Times

**The Economist Style:**
- January 15th 2024 (no comma)
- Not "1/15/24" (ambiguous internationally)
- 1990s (not 1990's)
- 21st century (not 21st Century)

**Decades:**
- "The 1990s" or "the nineties"
- Not "the 90s" in formal writing

---

## Part VII: Writing About People

### Names and Titles

#### First and Subsequent References

**First Mention:**
- Full name and relevant title/context
- "Joe Biden, America's president"
- "Mary Barra, chief executive of General Motors"

**Subsequent Mentions:**
- Surname only (British style)
- "Biden said..." (not "Mr Biden" after first mention)
- Exception: when confusion might arise

#### Titles and Positions

**The Economist Approach:**
- Descriptive over formal titles
- "America's president" not "President Biden"
- "Britain's prime minister" not "Prime Minister Sunak"
- Makes text timeless and clear

**Jobs, Not Honorifics:**
- Use job descriptions
- "The CEO" not "Mr Smith"
- "The finance minister" not "The Hon. Minister"

#### Gender and Description

**Fair Description:**
- Describe men and women the same way
- Don't mention appearance unless relevant
- Don't specify gender unless relevant
- Focus on qualifications and actions

**Avoid:**
- "The attractive CEO"
- "Mother of three Mary Smith"
- Unless you'd write "Father of three John Smith"

#### Age

**When to Mention:**
- When relevant to the story
- When it provides useful context
- Not gratuitously

**How:**
- Give exact age or range
- "The 35-year-old CEO"
- "The octogenarian investor"

---

## Part VIII: Political and Sensitive Language

### Neutrality and Precision

#### Loaded Language

**Avoid Bias:**
- One person's terrorist is another's freedom fighter
- Be specific: "militants," "rebels," "insurgents"
- Describe actions, not motives
- Let readers judge

**Examples:**

**Biased:** "The terrorist attack"
**Neutral:** "The bombing that killed 20 civilians"

**Biased:** "The brave freedom fighters"
**Neutral:** "The rebel group"

#### Political Terms

**Be Precise:**
- Don't use "liberal" and "conservative" loosely
- Specify: "fiscally conservative," "socially liberal"
- Define political positions by policies, not labels

**International Awareness:**
- "Liberal" means different things in different countries
- American liberals are left-wing; European liberals are centrist
- Explain when necessary

#### Sensitive Topics

**Race and Ethnicity:**
- Mention only when relevant
- Use people's preferred terms
- Be specific: "Nigerian" not "African" if you know
- Avoid stereotypes

**Disability:**
- Person-first language usually
- "People with disabilities" not "the disabled"
- But respect group preferences
- "Deaf community" may prefer "deaf people"

**Gender and Sexuality:**
- Use preferred pronouns
- Singular "they" is acceptable
- LGBTQ+ (not "the gays" or other casual terms)
- Mention only when relevant

### Euphemism and Plain Speaking

**The Economist Preference:**
- Call things what they are
- Avoid euphemisms that obscure meaning
- But don't be crude for effect

**Examples:**

**Euphemism → Plain:**
- Passed away → died
- Let go → fired
- Negative growth → contraction/decline
- Pre-owned → used
- Collateral damage → civilian casualties

**When Euphemism is Appropriate:**
- To avoid causing unnecessary pain
- When it's the accepted technical term
- When plain speaking would be gratuitously crude

---

## Part IX: Common Mistakes

### Frequently Confused Constructions

#### Different From/To/Than

**The Economist Standard:**
- "Different from" (preferred)
- "Different to" (acceptable in British English)
- "Different than" (avoid)

#### Literally

**Don't Abuse It:**
- "Literally" means actually, not figuratively
- Don't say "literally exploded" unless something actually exploded
- Often just delete it

#### Hopefully

**Use Carefully:**
- "Hopefully" means "in a hopeful manner"
- Not "it is hoped that"
- "He waited hopefully" ✓
- "Hopefully, profits will rise" ✗
- Better: "With luck, profits will rise" or "Profits may rise"

#### Unique

**No Degrees:**
- Something is unique or it isn't
- Not "very unique" or "quite unique"
- Unique means one of a kind
- Consider "unusual" or "rare" instead

#### Try and/Try to

**The Correct Form:**
- "Try to" not "try and"
- "Try to finish" not "try and finish"

### Logic and Meaning Errors

#### Mixed Metaphors

**Avoid Mixing:**
- "We'll tackle that bridge when we come to it"
- "It's not rocket surgery"
- Stick with one metaphor

#### Tautology

**Avoid Redundancy:**
- "Free gift" (gifts are free)
- "Past history" (history is past)
- "End result" (results come at the end)
- "Advance warning" (warnings come in advance)
- Just: gift, history, result, warning

#### Oxymorons (Unintentional)

**Watch For Contradictions:**
- "Somewhat unique"
- "Slightly pregnant"
- "A little bit dead"
- These qualities don't have degrees

#### False Comparisons

**Complete Your Comparisons:**

**Incomplete:** "Our prices are lower"
**Complete:** "Our prices are lower than our competitors'"

**Incomplete:** "The results were better"
**Complete:** "The results were better than last year's"

---

## Part X: Editing Principles

### The Editing Process

#### First Pass: Structure and Argument

**Big Picture Questions:**
- Is the main point clear?
- Does the structure make sense?
- Does everything support the argument?
- Is anything missing?
- What can be cut?

**Structural Editing:**
- Reorder paragraphs if needed
- Move important information forward
- Cut tangents
- Strengthen weak sections
- Remove redundancy

#### Second Pass: Sentence Level

**Line Editing:**
- Tighten sentences
- Improve word choice
- Fix grammar and punctuation
- Vary sentence length
- Improve rhythm

**Cut Ruthlessly:**
- Eliminate unnecessary words
- Delete weak adjectives
- Remove redundant phrases
- Trim qualifiers
- Pare hedging

#### Third Pass: Polish

**Final Check:**
- Correct spelling
- Verify facts
- Check consistency
- Read aloud for rhythm
- Fix typos

### Making Every Word Count

#### Words That Can Often Be Cut

**Throat-Clearing:**
- "It should be noted that"
- "It is important to remember"
- "As mentioned previously"
- Just make your point

**Qualifiers:**
- Very, quite, rather, somewhat
- Really, actually, basically
- Cut unless essential

**Redundant Pairs:**
- "First and foremost" → "first"
- "Each and every" → "every"
- "Hope and trust" → "hope"
- "Null and void" → "void"

**Padding:**
- "The question as to whether" → "whether"
- "There is no doubt that" → delete
- "It is clear that" → delete
- "The fact that" → "that" or delete

#### Strengthening Weak Verbs

**Replace Weak Verb + Adverb:**
- "Walked quickly" → "strode" or "hurried"
- "Looked briefly" → "glanced"
- "Ate quickly" → "devoured" or "wolfed down"

**Replace Nominalizations:**
- "Made a decision" → "decided"
- "Conducted an investigation" → "investigated"
- "Reached a conclusion" → "concluded"
- "Gave consideration to" → "considered"

---

## Part XI: Structure and Flow

### Organizing Your Writing

#### The Opening

**Lead With the Point:**
- First paragraph should state the main idea
- Don't warm up or throat-clear
- Give readers the payoff immediately
- Background can come later

**Poor Opening:**
"In today's rapidly changing business environment, companies face many challenges. Globalisation and technology have transformed the competitive landscape. This has important implications for strategy."

**Strong Opening:**
"General Motors will close three factories and lay off 15,000 workers as demand for sedans collapses. The cuts, announced yesterday, are the carmaker's largest since the 2009 crisis."

#### The Middle

**Logical Progression:**
- Each paragraph should follow naturally from the last
- Topic sentence states the paragraph's point
- Supporting sentences develop it
- Final sentence transitions or concludes

**Paragraph Length:**
- Vary for rhythm and readability
- Average: 3-5 sentences
- Single-sentence paragraphs occasionally for emphasis
- Break up dense paragraphs

**Transitions:**
- Should be implicit in the logic
- Avoid mechanical transitions ("furthermore," "moreover")
- Use when necessary but prefer logical flow

#### The Ending

**Strong Conclusions:**
- Don't just summarize
- Add a final insight
- Look forward or place in broader context
- Leave reader with something to think about

**Avoid:**
- "In conclusion"
- Merely restating what you've said
- Introducing new information
- Weak trailing off

---

## Part XII: International Writing

### Writing for a Global Audience

#### Avoid Parochialism

**Think Global:**
- Not everyone knows American references
- Explain local context
- Use international examples
- Consider readers in different countries

**Examples:**

**Parochial:** "The bill faces a tough fight in Congress"
**Global:** "The bill faces a tough fight in America's Congress"

**Parochial:** "Like EastEnders"
**Global:** "Like EastEnders, a British soap opera"

#### Cultural Sensitivity

**Be Aware:**
- Idioms don't translate
- Sports metaphors are culturally specific
- Holidays and seasons vary
- Historical references may not resonate

**Instead of American Football Metaphors:**
- Don't: "Monday-morning quarterback," "Hail Mary pass"
- Do: Use clear, literal language

**Instead of Seasonal References:**
- Not: "This spring's turmoil"
- Better: "The turmoil in March and April"

#### Measurements and Currency

**International Standards:**
- Use metric primarily
- Give imperial in parentheses if needed
- "100km (60 miles)"

**Currency:**
- Specify which dollar: "US$," "A$," "C$"
- Consider giving multiple currencies
- "€1 billion ($1.1 billion)"

#### Place Names

**The Economist Style:**
- English names where standard: "Munich" not "München"
- Local names where appropriate: "Beijing" not "Peking"
- Consistency once established

---

## Part XIII: Business and Economics Writing

### Clarity in Technical Subjects

#### Explaining Complex Concepts

**The Economist Method:**
- Start with the simplest explanation
- Build complexity gradually
- Use analogies
- Give concrete examples
- Define technical terms

**Example Structures:**

**For Economic Concepts:**
1. What it is in simple terms
2. Why it matters
3. How it works
4. Current example

**For Business Strategies:**
1. What the company is doing
2. Why (the business logic)
3. The expected impact
4. The risks or challenges

#### Financial Writing

**Be Clear and Specific:**
- Distinguish revenue from profit
- Specify which profit (operating, net, etc.)
- Give context for numbers
- Explain what they mean

**Example:**
"Revenue rose 10% to $5 billion, but operating profit fell 5% to $500m as costs increased faster than sales. The company blamed higher raw-material prices."

#### Avoiding Business Jargon

**Common Offenders:**

**Jargon → Plain English:**
- Onboard → hire / bring on
- Bandwidth → time / capacity
- Deliverables → results / products
- Action (verb) → do / implement
- Learnings → lessons
- Ask (noun) → request / requirement

---

## Part XIV: Metaphors and Figures of Speech

### Using Metaphors Effectively

#### When Metaphors Help

**Good Metaphors:**
- Illuminate complex ideas
- Make abstract concepts concrete
- Are fresh and apt
- Enhance understanding

**Example:**
"The company's debt is a millstone around its neck" (clear image of burden)

#### When to Avoid Metaphors

**Bad Metaphors:**
- Are clichéd
- Are mixed
- Obscure meaning
- Show off rather than clarify

**Avoid:**
- "Let's put this to bed and get it off the ground"
- "We need to drink our own champagne"
- "Let's open the kimono on this"

#### Analogies

**Useful for Explanation:**
- Compare unfamiliar to familiar
- Make technical concepts accessible
- Should be apt and clear

**Example:**
"Quantum computers process information like a crystal ball examining all possible futures simultaneously, while classical computers are like an abacus working through calculations one by one."

---

## Part XV: House Rules

### Specific Economist Conventions

#### Capitalization

**Minimal Caps:**
- Job titles lowercase: "the president," "the chief executive"
- Government departments initial caps: "the Treasury"
- Regions lowercase unless part of name: "southern China" but "South Korea"
- Seasons lowercase: "spring," "autumn"

#### Spelling

**British English Standard:**
- -ise not -ize (organise, realise)
- -our not -or (labour, colour)
- -re not -er (centre, theatre)
- But: use American spellings for American subjects when appropriate

#### Abbreviations

**General Rule:**
- Spell out on first use with abbreviation in parentheses
- Use abbreviation thereafter
- "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said... The IMF also..."

**Common Exceptions:**
- Well-known: NATO, EU, UN, GDP, CEO

#background: The Economist was founded in 1843 by Scottish economist James Wilson to advocate for free trade during the Corn Laws debate. The publication established a distinctive editorial approach: articles appear anonymously to emphasize collective wisdom over individual bylines, assuming an intelligent but non-specialist readership interested in rigorous analysis of global affairs. Over 180 years, The Economist developed a reputation for analytical depth combined with remarkably clear, accessible prose. The Style Guide, first published in 1986, codified the writing principles that had evolved organically—clarity, precision, brevity, and reader-focused communication—and has since influenced generations of journalists, business writers, and professionals worldwide who seek to explain complex topics with the same combination of authority and accessibility.
