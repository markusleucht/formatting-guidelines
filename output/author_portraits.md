## Paul Graham
#2000s

Paul Graham was born in England in 1964, moved to Pittsburgh as a child, and pursued an unusual combination of philosophy at Cornell and computer science at Harvard, while simultaneously studying painting in Rhode Island and Florence—a blend that would define his unique perspective as a "hacker philosopher." After creating Viaweb and selling it to Yahoo, he could have retired wealthy, but instead co-founded Y Combinator in 2005 with his future wife Jessica Livingston and two friends, revolutionizing how startups get funded by betting small amounts on people rather than polished business plans. Graham's essays, written in a distinctively conversational style on paulgraham.com, became required reading in Silicon Valley not through marketing but through insight—he thinks out loud, works through ideas publicly, and writes with a clarity that makes complex entrepreneurial concepts accessible. Steven Levy calls him a "hacker philosopher" because he bridges technical rigor with humanistic thinking, equally comfortable discussing Lisp programming and Renaissance painting. He stepped back from Y Combinator's daily operations in 2014 and now lives in England with Livingston and their two children, continuing to write essays that shape how a generation thinks about startups, technology, and innovation.

## Rolf Hichert
#2000s

Rolf Hichert followed a path from mechanical engineering through academia to consulting that shaped his lifelong mission to make business communication universally understandable. After earning his doctorate in mechanical engineering at the Fraunhofer Institute and teaching marketing and project management as a professor at the University of Applied Sciences in Constance in the early 1980s, he joined McKinsey & Company where he encountered Gene Zelazny and discovered his passion for professional visualization. Rather than accepting the status quo of chaotic, inconsistent business reports, Hichert became convinced that business communication should achieve the universal clarity of musical notation or electrical diagrams—standards anyone trained could read regardless of language. From 2004, he dedicated himself entirely to this vision, co-founding Hichert+Partner with Jürgen Faisst and publishing the SUCCESS Rules in 2008. In a remarkable act of intellectual generosity, he transferred his intellectual property to the newly founded IBCS Association in 2013 under a Creative Commons license, choosing open dissemination over commercial control. Today, as president of the IBCS Association, he continues advocating for a world where business reports actually report something—clearly, consistently, and comprehensibly.

## Barbara Minto
#1970s

Barbara Minto's journey from secretary earning "$400 a month" at an American railway company to pioneering consultant reveals a woman who refused to accept limited options. Concerned her supervisor's poor health threatened her livelihood, she boldly applied to Harvard Business School without an undergraduate degree, passed the entrance exam, and graduated in 1963 as one of only eight women in a class of 600 men. McKinsey & Company hired her as their first female MBA consultant—Cleveland first, then London—where she initially struggled with number-crunching but discovered her true genius: making complex thinking clear through writing. While her male colleagues focused on analysis, Minto revolutionized how consultants structure their thinking, developing what became the Pyramid Principle and inventing the MECE framework (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) that now underpins strategic thinking globally. When McKinsey laid off staff during the 1973 Oil Crisis, Minto didn't retreat—she built her own training business, eventually publishing "The Pyramid Principle" in 1985. Decades later, her frameworks remain fundamental to consulting and business communication worldwide, proof that clear thinking expressed clearly transcends any single firm or generation.

## The Economist
#1980s

Founded in 1843, The Economist has become globally renowned for its analytical rigor, clarity of writing, and distinctive house style that publishes articles anonymously to emphasize collective wisdom over individual bylines. The Economist Style Guide, first published in 1986, has influenced generations of journalists and business writers with its emphasis on precision, brevity, and clarity, becoming essential reading for business leaders, policymakers, and educated readers worldwide. Its approach to communication—combining data-driven analysis with accessible prose—has shaped how professionals think about clear, effective business writing far beyond journalism.

## Stephen King
#1970s

Stephen King grew up in difficult circumstances—father abandoned the family when he was a toddler, mother struggled financially working in institutional kitchens—but found escape and purpose through reading and writing. From rural Maine schools to the University of Maine at Orono, where he met his wife Tabitha in the library stacks, King wrote constantly: newspaper columns, short stories, novels drafted in spare moments. While teaching high school English at Hampden Academy and writing evenings and weekends, living paycheck to paycheck, Doubleday accepted "Carrie" in 1973, finally allowing him to write full-time at age 26. Over five decades, he's published more than 50 books, becoming one of the world's most successful writers, yet he remains remarkably grounded—still living in Maine with Tabitha (also a novelist), still writing daily, still generous with advice in "On Writing" that resonates beyond horror fiction to any writer seeking honest craft guidance. Despite massive commercial success, King writes with the discipline of someone who remembers scraping by, the work ethic of a former teacher, and the gratitude of someone who found his calling early and never took it for granted.

## Heinrich von Kleist
#1800s

Heinrich von Kleist (1777-1811) war ein rastloser Geist, dessen kurzes Leben von einem unerbittlichen Streben nach einem unerreichbaren Ideal geprägt war. Mit fünfzehn Jahren verwaist, verließ er als junger Leutnant die preußische Armee, nachdem er "sieben wertvolle Jahre" verloren glaubte. Die Lektüre Kants erschütterte seinen Glauben an die Erkennbarkeit der Welt fundamental—eine existenzielle Krise, aus der er nie vollständig herausfand. Kleist war ein Mensch extremer Gefühlszustände, getrieben von einer dämonischen Genialität, die seine Zeit nicht zu würdigen wusste. Besonders Goethes Ablehnung traf ihn tief. Sein Leben war eine Suche nach Anerkennung, nach Wahrheit, nach einem Platz in einer Welt, die ihm fremd blieb. Am 21. November 1811, enttäuscht und verbittert, erschoss er am Kleinen Wannsee erst Henriette Vogel, dann sich selbst—ein geplanter Doppelsuizid als letzter Akt eines verzweifelten Lebens. Erst Jahrzehnte nach seinem Tod erkannten Realisten, Expressionisten und Existenzialisten in ihm ihren Prototyp: einen Dichter, der moderne Probleme des Lebens und der Literatur vorausgeahnt hatte.
