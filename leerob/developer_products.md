# On Developer Products

## 1. You should embrace open-source

Experienced developers appreciate open-source products because they've faced difficulties debugging "black box" closed-source alternatives or witnessed tools shift licensing models. Newcomers value open-source because these skills transfer across employers and typically feature superior documentation.

## 2. You should have a free tier

Developers prefer minimal friction when evaluating tools—they want to test products independently rather than engage sales teams. Once they've confirmed the solution meets their needs, growth follows naturally. While some enterprise software requires negotiated access, developers would generally prefer self-service options.

## 3. You should have excellent documentation

"The better the documentation, the more likely the developer is to try your product." Documentation serves dual purposes: reference guides and educational materials. Quality educational content appeals to both beginners and experts by explaining concepts clearly and progressively, avoiding information overload upfront.

## 4. You should be able to get support from developers

When documentation falls short, developers seek support from people who genuinely understand their challenges. Effective support minimizes handoffs between problem and resolution. Developer Advocates and Customer Success Engineers exist precisely because developers expect technical peers.

## 5. You should be part of a community

Rather than creating isolated product communities, successful companies engage where developers already congregate online and offline. Value provision takes priority over transactions—building relationships that yield returns over years rather than months.
